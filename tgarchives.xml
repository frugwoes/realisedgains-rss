      <content>I don&amp;#x27;t believe this movement to be a genuine movement, at least on ALTs, this will just be a short squeeze where futures prices move the spot prices and the spot prices just move up because order books are thin.</content>

      <content>A lot of Crypto NFT/Gaming Coins like Mines of Dalarnia (DAR) will go to zero with this drop, even if BTC bounces, I don&amp;#x27;t expect worthless games to hold any value. If you&amp;#x27;re waiting for a relief bounce to sell, I would say don&amp;#x27;t hold your breath.</content>

      <content>21th JanLong 37. 8 to 38. 5 regionStart closing at Resistance- 39. 2-39. 2 (1st TP) 40% CloseRemainder 60% put with a trailing stop loss as we attempt to run up to the lower probability (2nd TP)- 40. 7-40. 9 (2nd TP) 40% CloseLast TP for all would be 46/47k and 53/55kTo me (1st TP) is a very high probabilistic play. I am not touching much alts at the moment, but that‚Äôs because considering my size isn‚Äôt small, i will have to deal with too much slippage issues. Will advise differently for smaller portfolios. Alternatively ETH can also be done with this ranges. Will update on Stocks &amp;amp; Commodities later!</content>

      <content>Taking some profits at 39. 1 - 39. 3 region as I stated. Will teach you guys how to ladder out exits as well. Then change to a trailing stop loss to de-risk.

      <content>(Crypto) How I am managing this range is basically using my previous profits I took at 39. 2 from 38. 4 as a buffer for current positions. Still in some longs with a trailing stop loss. Will come up with some Udemy materials and guides soon! Was very patient waiting for this 38k region and that&amp;#x27;s how you should be in these markets ü§ôüèª Bigger resistance range is still as mentioned at the 40. 7 - 40. 9k region, got some serious liquidity to tap there.</content>

      <content>Like I said on 17th December above, if you are into NFT/Gaming Coins I think they have no value fundamentally. Coins like $DAR, $AXS will crash very very heavily. These have dropped 60-80% from ATH but BTC is only on a 50% drop. This is the reason I only buy $BTC, $ETH, or L1 coins if I am doing value investing. If you want to buy the dip, buy fundamental stuff. A lot of things will die with this pullback.</content>

      <content>I would say to stay calm at these prices, I don&amp;#x27;t think we go to 20s, I think we hold here in the 30s for awhile before we get a relief short squeeze back to 37. 8k - 38. 8k (this might be a chance to exit or take profits), after that bounce we have to reassess if back in a bull market or consider the global situation to see if we enter a recession/hard correction. Funding is negative which is rare for most markets as it&amp;#x27;s normally a buyers market. Crypto/Stocks movements now actually rely heavily on the Russia Situation, Interest Rate Policies I believe.</content>

      <content>Holding my Crypto Positions, got some $SOL, $FTT on that dip, as well as still in long. $CLOV i am still laddering in, very very slowly around $2. 5-$2. 6, floor can be deep on this one! My rationale for stocks are to take a much longer swing as opposed to Crypto. Normally for Crypto I am more of a swing trader as I think the markets are much more volatile, you have to get in and out fast. For Stocks, I can normally do 3-5 months even to let my idea play out.</content>

      <content>if this doesn&amp;#x27;t hold, it could just range within this region, which is also something i&amp;#x27;m expecting. but in general this is a very speculative style of trading doing daily candles. if you&amp;#x27;re doing a wider swing play lets say weekly/monthly, i think buying here for a longer term hold for a more chill, wider region play isn&amp;#x27;t bad either. ^ not sure if this makes sense. will explain it in a future video.</content>

      <content>If you entered the 35. 1, watch the 35. 5-35. 6 region if we hold there or reject, this is another decent entry i believe but just be cautious with your stop loss. i generally don&amp;#x27;t day trade much tbh. just that after yesterday&amp;#x27;s big drop it&amp;#x27;s lucrative to play these ranges.

      <content>Think we are range bound here for awhile. Would not be taking shorts at these prices. It&amp;#x27;s basically long C with tight stop aim for range high at D to go for a short and place a stop. Do this 1-2 swings and get out if you are day/swing trading. You can only do this after a big movement and only for your first 2-3 swings. I would probably stop around Wednesday. Fridays tend to more volatile. My Bias now is long cause R:R for shorting simply isn&amp;#x27;t good. . . I think we should still relief to 37. 7k eventually, just be slow to ladder in positions you should be fine üëçüèº</content>

      <content>Quite interesting; I always notice this trend, I&amp;#x27;ll scour other exchanges or new options bids to confluence my ideas. Interesting how this squeeze on Bitstamp predated the movement on every other exchange subsequently that there would be a short squeeze. This has actually happened many times before. Bitcoin actually went to 8k a couple months back on a flash crash long squeeze on Binance US, that move also made me cautious and gave me confluence into predicting 66k was the top!</content>

      <content>already had my idea on this region 2 days back as you can see. but i tend to watch OI, liquidations and options ticker to find where to long exactly. 33. 3k just felt like max pain to me. most people expect a swing failure bottom and the low to not break past previous lows which is exactly the reason why it needs to do that, to bait breakout traders and then trap them to provide liquidity for impetus to push the subsequent run-up. on the opposite end, it did this at the top too, went to highs of 65k, drop, rise back to 69k and bait the most amount of breakout bullish investors, and then reject so harshly to 33k, trapping them indefinitely. its beautiful to see üòÇ</content>

      <content>Next resistance for BTC would be 41. 2 - 41. 5, I would not mind gandering a small short there *if we get there* FOMC hearing this week, Powell discussing 4 interest rates hike this year, ideally means we still see 2022 as a very bad year for investing.

      <content>If you closed some where I suggested at 36. 6, this region is a possible reshort at 38-38. 2k. Alternatively, if you are low leveraged, just hold it and ignore this (PA) Price Action. Still think we range and downtrend is still intact. Macro view remains unchanged. These areas are where I would be less speculative. I always expected a bounce at the end of January cause of the Tax Harvesting wash trade rule ending (mentioned this a couple of times).

      <content>just to be clear, most times when i take a position, i give room for error for it to go to my next region. what this means is don&amp;#x27;t go all-in on your short at 38. 9k with your stop loss or liquidation at 40. 6k, i always give allowance just in case we go to the 2nd region, unlikely but always plausible. basically, take a short, not large, but enough to make some profits. i generally just keep doing this and compounding profits.</content>

      <content>($BTC) Strict Invalidation at the 41. 8k region. Weekends normally trap longs!A bit early on the short but I think we still retest supports:40. 4k-40. 6k (Weak)(80% Probability)39. 5-39. 8k (Weak) (Might not close here, just trailing SL to let it run deeper)37. 8-38. 5k (Strong) (40% probability) Should be flipping longs at the 37-38k region if we get there! Expecting a bounce if we get there! However as always, if we do breach 41k I will cut my positions, this is the last stand for this high volume node. watch this region very very closely if we do need to cut. my gut would be just to ladder in shorts slowly and use miniscule leverage. i generally keep shorts leverage much smaller than for longs.</content>

      <content>The 41k region is a key resistance after all. . . Depending on whether this holds, I would suggest the next strong resistance to be 46. 5 - 46. 9.

      <content>As mentioned earlier here, held my 34. 3k longs to the resistance regions but the attempts to flip short I&amp;#x27;ve had to cut. It&amp;#x27;s a good thing we rode the large longs up but had to give back some profits to the market from the shorts. It&amp;#x27;s part of trading I guess!Depending on the conviction you should opt for different sizing. General rule of thumb is to always go less size on shorts cause it&amp;#x27;s just generally a poorer alternative. I normally opt for 1-3x Leverage for Longs &amp;amp; 0. 5-1. 5x Leverage for Shorts. This would ultimately depend on your own account size as well. On a 2x Leverage long, it requires a 50% drop to liquidate you. On a 2x Leverage short, it requires a 100% gain to liquidate you. Even above that, since you&amp;#x27;re normally DCA-ing your entries, we essentially have no chance of liquidations unless we have black-swan flash crash events. However, in view of such lowered leverages. Most ideas &amp;amp; positions I hold out for 1-2 weeks normally. Hope that makes sense!</content>

      <content>Not currently in a position but I think the larger macro downtrend is still intact across markets. Don&amp;#x27;t think we see ATH as I said. CPI is 7. 5, expecting hawkish policies and interest rate hikes on March 16th.</content>

      <content>Didn&amp;#x27;t exactly hit 46. 5k, we only went up to 46050. That&amp;#x27;s kind of what happens when you try to time it too exactly. Fortunately we at least took the longs up to there. CPI news should push the broader markers down. Not opting for shorts at the moment. Just buying put options on certain stocks that&amp;#x27;s all, largely puts for TSLA at 910 targeting wayy lower 750 even but i&amp;#x27;ll watch as it goes there ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§´</content>

      <content>Hi guys! Just a weekend update. Think overall trend is still down, max we can possibly see for a resistance would be 43. 3-43. 8k. With the CPI data, I am expecting more downside with Crypto. Same story for stocks, I think $ABNB &amp;amp; $TSLA are still good for sells or puts. With current market conditions I am just not keen on buying for long term holds or value investing. Value investing would imply I have to see value at these prices and I think further downside should not be ruled out!</content>

      <content>Looking at 43. 8k for $BTC; We are reaching there now. . . $ABNB &amp;amp; $TSLA might form a double top today. Today will be an interesting day to trade. As always, employ smaller size and slower laddering if you are new.</content>

      <content>(Crypto) Entirety of this red region 44-46k is great for shorting on the larger time frame; i&amp;#x27;m talking on a weekly candle basis. . . Just don&amp;#x27;t overleverage, you should be fine. If you entered earlier, i&amp;#x27;ll just lower the margin size when I reach breakeven, we should retrace back down to low 43s at least so you can definitely get some positions out and re-short again higher. These are not regions i&amp;#x27;ll be taking longs or being bullish already. Short R:R is better.</content>

      <content>(Short Guide on Crypto Futures)What I mean by this is that I am gonna ladder in shorts slowly but I expect a sweep of the lows eventually on the larger time frames so as long as you can hold down the position, I think long run it&amp;#x27;s okay. Besides funding pays shorters right now so you are paid to open shorts. Like I mentioned previously, my shorts I tend to use 0. 5 - 1x Leverage, longs I use 0. 5-2x Leverage for Crypto. (This is for me personally). This style is a much more slower, passive way towards trading; position trading. Just laddering in entries much slower for larger swings. . . i. e. if using a 1k account$200 at 44. 8k short$200 at 46. 5k short$200 at 46. 9k shortThis employs $600/$1000 (60% Margin used) (0. 6x Leverage) Which would put liquidation at 76. 3k for your short contracts to liquidate you. Also makes your average entry around 45-46k overall; which is the end goal objective. If we break this region then i&amp;#x27;ll consider cutting losses. If eventually we take profit at range lows of 38k. That would still net a 21% gain off $600 which would be $126. That&amp;#x27;s a 12. 6% off your $1000 Capital. I prefer to do this style as it&amp;#x27;s just overall less stress with lower leverage and in this choppy/rangy market. Accumulating 10-15% each month can still be a decent amount long term!Just teaching you guys how to ladder in positions. I think at the end of the day, patience overall makes all the difference.</content>

      <content>Also hope you guys cut your margin just now. 43. 8 just wasn&amp;#x27;t a good initial entry but we did revisit it just now a 2nd time.

      <content>18th February Update:Summary on my own Trades$ROKU went up another 5% from 168 but got rejected hard off the 9 day MA and 0. 236. Entered at 141 but took profits quick on the rejection closing at 168-170. As I mentioned above, I am pretty quick to take profits on my longs in this market, which also makes me lose out on some potential gains but that&amp;#x27;s the nature of the market, I abide by the trend. . . Entered $ABNB at 140 and sold off at 163 so missed out the move from 163 to 190. But it‚Äôs also hard to time a perfect time if there are short squeezes. Not gonna beat myself up too much, profits are profits. I am not a perfectionist. . Entered $BTC at 34k sold 41k, missed the move up after that but took the short from 43. 8k to here, so I think that makes up for the mistimed long close‚Ä¶ Still in shorts but watching!Only one down a tiny bit for me is $FDX bought at 227/228, now trading at 226. Probably going to take the loss. But 0. 5% loss on 1 trade, couldn‚Äôt care less since the rest made much more.</content>

Looking for 38. 6-37. 8k for a 80% close on my short positions from 43. 8k. Then I‚Äôll look for a bounce at D to consider a re-short with a trailing SL.

      <content>21th February Update:(Crypto)Expecting a small bounce for $BTC to the 38. 6-38. 8k region from here (38. 3k) at least and 39. 5 at most (Even if we get here, I don&amp;#x27;t think we hold there for long, so I&amp;#x27;m not gonna bother longing here). Clear downtrending pattern already. Think we can expect continuation. Still short-biased, rips are for shorting. I am still 60% closed so not re-shorting; just looking to time my short closes, and potentially re-short higher. It&amp;#x27;s a good rule of thumb of mine to just simply not short as it goes down. I prefer to ride with my current position as opposed to exposing myself to more margin risk. Generally, you can also short alts but I think that really depends on your contract size or if the alts can support your liquidity. I don&amp;#x27;t tend to do that cause alts have more volatility and might not have enough liquidity to support my size. (US Stocks)Why I say Lockheed Martin $LMT is because it&amp;#x27;s a defense stock that is tied in very closely with defense budget of the US and is mainly funded by that. Threats of war will of course highly correlate with this stock&amp;#x27;s prices. I&amp;#x27;ll do a video/newsletter on this. In short, the U. S. government has agreed to take delivery of 133-139 aircraft and 151-153 F-35 aircraft in 2022 and 2023. While we can expect the FEDs to cut spending, I don&amp;#x27;t think this will be in the form of defence budgets tightening as with a volatile economic/political climate, I would expect Defence to be of higher precedence even. . .</content>

      <content>(Crypto)I&amp;#x27;ll spell it out abit more explicitly. Closed 60% of my shorts already at C from B (average close of 38. 2), not longing from C to D due to poor R:R, just laddering in re-shorts of the same size of 60% at D (38. 6-38. 8k 30/60%) and (39. 5-39. 8k 30/60%). Something like this. Hope this makes sense! Update again soon. (US Stocks)Stacking up on $LMT slowly but it already did a run-up. I&amp;#x27;ve been stacking for a year now.

      <content>21st February Update:As suggested we&amp;#x27;re making a run-up to 39. 5k region, I&amp;#x27;ll look for closes on longs or re-shorts there. As per yesterday&amp;#x27;s poll i&amp;#x27;ll try to do 1 quick update per day. At least giving my inter-range for trading. However, if you&amp;#x27;re taking such trades I would think that the hit rate would be much lower. I think that so far I have been pretty spot on but like I said, with greater frequency, you would have to take lower probability trade setups more on the intra day. Still juggling my school &amp;amp; work commitments cause I don&amp;#x27;t intend to full-time trade for the basis of mental sanity and also in pursuit of diversifying my income/cash flow further. As such i&amp;#x27;ll probably structure and label it into 2 setups. (1) Weekly High Probability Set-ups: This is what I personally trade due to my time schedule but i&amp;#x27;ll give you guys (2) as an add-on but i&amp;#x27;ll put a disclaimer and say that (2) is not what i&amp;#x27;m personally trading.

      <content>21st February UpdateBTC &amp;amp; Crypto(1) Larger Time Frame Swings- Still on a Downtrend, we could see relief to 39-40k but even then this will be short-lived. On a low leverage these prices shouldn‚Äôt bother you. Alternatively would be of course OTM put options which I personally employ but nothing too fancy. By laddering exits on shorts as suggest from 38. 6 - 37. 8k, I think you should have perfectly captured the bottom at 37. 9 yesterday. I&amp;#x27;m only beginning to ladder re-shorts now. (2) Short-Term Trade Range:- $BTC faces strong resistance at 39. 6-39. 8k. Laddering in shorts with an invalidation at 40. 3k or tighter is a possible play. Trend still down till we sweep the lows properly, consolidate and hold. Then we‚Äôll have to watch if the floor holds. US Stocks(1) Long Term Holds- Stuff I think that will still retain value in for a long-term hold. Covered Calls on $T still work. AT&amp;amp;T is still a necessity and is still profitable as both a business and for doing a CC strategy. If you don‚Äôt have enough capital to do CCs. Consider doing PMCCs. (2) Inter-Day Trading Range- $TSLA puts till under 800 still logical to me. $FSLY $SHOP &amp;amp; $CLOV at reaching very oversold territories at 18. 70, 2. 11 and 650 respectively at GMT+8 11am now. Might punt a buy soon but none of these are fundamentally sound except $SHOP imo. As always, NFA &amp;amp; DYOR. I personally only do longer term positions.</content>

      <content>(Crypto)For $BTC, we&amp;#x27;re trading at 37. 6k now! As to why I suggested not to take longs and only look for re-shorts! Targeting a sweep of the next lows. Think next support is 35. 8 - 36. 3k, will possibly look for closes on the shorts there. However, I think this is a weak support. If they give you 33/34k I will definitely put a trailing stop loss/take profits. Still in my put options and fully re-shorted already. Re-shorted the 60% I closed 30% at 38. 7k and 30% at 39. 5k.

      <content>22 February 2021:(Crypto)Still downtrending. Any rips should be short-lived, wouldn&amp;#x27;t consider any longs until 35. 8-36. 3k which we are fairly close now! Just make sure you ladder your exits well in that region! If you want to run it down you can place a trailing SL/TP when it reaches under 36. 3k; what this does is if it continues down you give it the chance to, however if it bounces up this strat immediately TPs. I&amp;#x27;ll look for re-shorts after closing this bounce from 35. 8-36. 3k if the bounce is strong. As I mentioned won&amp;#x27;t be doing alts, unless ETH, BNB, FTT, KCS.

      <content>What I mean by the last part was that we choose high correlation alt coins to short in confluence with a downtrending $BTC. This will make you more profits with less leverage as alts tend to fall harder than BTC. This takes a bit of tweaking cause I correlate this data with BTC dominance and do a simple correlation graph to see what works the best for this strategy. Those I listed are what I personally do. This strategy lets you take the same position with less leverage to make the same gains.</content>

      <content>22nd February Update(Crypto)Trailing SL triggered at 36. 5k for $BTC so took off 30% some profits there. Still in about 60-70% shorts entered at my 2nd reshort of 39. 5k. Whenever we reach an area of support I tend to employ a trailing TP then just walk away. If we continue down, we let it run. Knowing when to put a trailing SL especially placed at a support region can be crucial. Anyway, not too concerned, just a squeeze for late shorters - maybe a quick tap up to 38. 4-38. 6k for liquidity but I believe trend is still down! If we get another retest down to 36. 3k region (+- 0. 3k) I would put another trailing SL! Hope this makes sense. (US Stocks)Same old. Puts in $TSLA still not closed, have time cause it&amp;#x27;s a 6 months options contract. Not suffering too heavily in Theta Decay. Possibly laddering buys for $SHOP $CLOV very soon. Overall a pretty decent month so far!</content>

      <content>I think this can be a saviour at times! Better off than trying to pick a perfect bottom to close, when we reach nearing a support region just put a trailing SL for 50% of suggested close and 50% at targeted close for the amount you want to close. So if it bounces you&amp;#x27;ll be guaranteed to take profits. Like I said, no one ever died taking profits. Sorry if I am a lil spammy lately, trying to do as suggested and update more often!</content>

      <content>Not my cleanest cut, should have held it a little longer, closed some at 38. 4-38. 6 cause I was a lil panicky. Should trust the gut more in the future. Taking 1-2 days off unless Crypto unless it reaches where I want to long or short. Not trading this inter-range as it consolidates. I don&amp;#x27;t like trading Wave CDE on the ABCDE Elliot wave on principle. (Refer to Image)Closed 90% of my short futures but still have put options fro 44k so not re-shorting at the moment.

      <content>Didn&amp;#x27;t get here unfortunately. I&amp;#x27;ll honestly not try to time it so much when. Made a mistake by cutting some at 38. 4, when my leverage and size were actually good enough to hold the short down forever. I think that&amp;#x27;s the &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; with trying to be more active. The more I stare at it, the more itchy fingers I get. I believe a lower leveraged/sized larger swing outweighs touching a position everyday even!Gonna optimise again. However puts on stocks still made me a decent chunk and I do still have crypto put options so it&amp;#x27;s okay! Still up a bunch for this month üëåüèº Hope you guys are too!</content>

Waited soooo long for this! $CLOV is a riskier bet i&amp;#x27;m just doing miniscule laddering but r:r for buys pretty good at these prices! we will definitely have short squeezes for this counter soon if you are not overlevered and can hold a buy position!</content>

      <content>41. 7 - 42. 5k is a strong area of resistance for BTC. I&amp;#x27;ll probably opt to trailing stop loss if we break 40k and take a full profit at the suggested resistance, perhaps even flip short at 41. 7-42. 5k at the higher end of that resistance.

      <content>Still holding most positions till minimally next week to reassess, will employ trailing stop losses or a stop loss in entry still, don&amp;#x27;t think we crash twice so fast without squeezing late shorts, so doubt we retrace back to entries. (UNLESS WW3 happens which then it&amp;#x27;s entirely out of my control). Off the bat, resistance areas would be:835-840 $TSLA (already 820 on pre-market)163-165 $ABNB745 $SHOPpotentially the only one I might take profits here, - $CLOV (we had a crazy run on this 20-30% last day)All of these should be in decent 10-20% profits without any leverage/margin already. I am not buying to hold at these prices, think Macro and economic climate still too bearish. So gonna opt to take profits faster.</content>

      <content>Been viewing $SHOP $CLOV more often than other the previous few days, cause I mentioned specifically these 2 were heavily oversold. I think $CLOV already did a fair enough bounce, waiting on $SHOP to go a bit higher!Unfortunately if you weren&amp;#x27;t awake at 3am last night it would have been difficult to catch good entries but I still think we have legs on $SHOP, $TSLA for a little bit. $CLOV, $ABNB and $BTC would not be a strong buy for me here. 1 Key Indicator you can use as a contrarian indicator would be to look at the VIX or VVIX levels; these are inverse ETFs, generally if VIX is above 35 and VVIX is 150 or closing there, we can see it as a sign of possible relief. Many people use VIX to hedge, so if it reaches these levels you can expect the opposite movement on the general markets. As people take profits on inverse ETFs, this can also provide short-term relief indirectly to the underlying ETF. There are a few indicators I personally use: RSI, VPVR, Max Pain Options, VIX/VVIX Levels, your usual MA &amp;amp; Stochastics. Will try teach them slowly here.</content>

      <content>$TSLA at 845 onwards right now as I suggested is a sell for me on a short-term time frame. Been targeting this number in both the groups under 750 I was signalling a buy. Do think we have potential for more upward movements but if you have any leveraged/margin positions I would be at least taking profits. Not opening puts or shorting yet but closing call options. $BTC at resistance for me. As I mentioned earlier 40. 5k onwards is not a bad position to attempt short ladders. $CLOV I think will meet short-term resistance at 2. 8. Not a buy here nor short. Just areas to continually take profits from our buys a week ago. $SHOP I am still holding. Being patient with this awhile longer, still in profit but not a lot. Initial entry still 650. $ABNB hope you took some profits at the resistance I mentioned a few days prior. I am still holding my spot positions for these. Not too concerned. Think we still have a strong floor at 130-140.</content>

      <content>Same plan on $BTC as a week ago. Tiny short ladders or take profits at our current resistance. However, given the nature of this latest $BTC movement. I am more inclined we do a liquidation cascade on shorts to tap into the 41. 4-42. 5k region. If I were to short and prospectively aim for a perfect entry i&amp;#x27;ll try 42. 5-42. 9k. There&amp;#x27;s strong liquidity to tap there. Anything before that on a down-bias should just be tiny shorts or take profits on longs. General bias and trend is still down for me. I do not believe we are in a bull-run period! Put Options may not be entirely bad if you got 3 months out.</content>

      <content>3 March Update:42. 6-42. 9k is another crucial level for $BTC to hold. Still think the trend is down but if you ever want to de-risk or lower your margin/leverage of your shorts, you can close some positions there. I find it easier to hold positions when they&amp;#x27;re smaller. Less stressful as well! Looking more into stocks at the moment cause the FOMC hearing &amp;amp; Global Tensions make it that there is quite a lot of liquidity and risk on movements to take. Potentially looking at puts for $TSLA soon now, considering we&amp;#x27;re double testing out 879-882 region. Starting to ladder in small puts. Think this goes to 920 at max on the short time-frame, so I&amp;#x27;ll ladder in with knowledge of that. $CLOV $ABNB not trading at the moment, fully out of calls still. $SHOP still holding awhile more as I mentioned!</content>

      <content>$CLOV if you are still holding buys I suggest to cut. I was just buying for the short squeeze potential at $2 to $2. 80. Already a 40% gain. $TSLA attempting puts to ladder at 895-910. I think if you spread out your shorts/puts/takeprofits on this region; we will retrace after. Ruble has been crashing hard, been just researching into Russian Banks &amp;amp; Defence Stocks lately. Still holding my $LMT!For $BTC if I am still on my shorts I will probably deleverage some then attempt to short higher. However, I still believe we see lower in the coming months.

Will update this more tomorrow ‚úåüèº$CLOV no positions. $SHOP got stopped out at close to breakeven. $BTC still on shorts/puts from 44k (haven&amp;#x27;t touched these in ages, willing to ladder if it goes up but i&amp;#x27;ll cut if we break 46k)</content>

      <content>4th March:For BTC shorts from 42. 9k-44k. Think we break under 40k for one more sweep. If we&amp;#x27;re in a consolidation wedge which is what I am thinking. Safe TP around 38. 8k mark. I think if we get a move it should be now. So I am finally putting stops but I&amp;#x27;ll try to let this run to TP. Hard to explain my ideas through text but general idea is in the charts.</content>

      <content>4th March 2022:For $BTC you can be patient. Think the longs are already trapped; Looking at 38. 8k prospectively, i&amp;#x27;ll reassess later how and where to ladder out shorts to take profits or roll longer. There are 2 waves I drew: one is a elliot extension wave, one is a consolidation wave to form a triangle wedge. Not sure which one forms yet. Leaning on triangle wedge since we&amp;#x27;re still far out from any news like the FOMC hearing or crucial CME expiration dates. As I mentioned above, I didn&amp;#x27;t get a perfect entry either. . . mostly started laddering shorts at 42. 9-44k. I mentioned I would cut if we did get 46/47k. It&amp;#x27;s okay to not be perfect all the time, just understand the general trend and slowly ladder!$TSLA so far has been playing out very perfectly. Took profits from $730 at $870-882 and flipped to puts from 878-882. Holding these and not adding. I principally don&amp;#x27;t add on my size even if they&amp;#x27;re small. I am okay with smaller profits as long as they&amp;#x27;re consistent! Will chart this out by next week. So far still a decent week!</content>

      <content>38. 8k should be a safe TP. Think we break under 40k and potentially consolidate in this region awhile longer till the FOMC hearing. . . I would probably close and opt to re-short closer to hearing date. As I mentioned, longs are trapped already. I have been short-biased the entire month if you can&amp;#x27;t tell. . . Don&amp;#x27;t think we break to 46/47k anytime soon actually. Watching $ABNB $TSLA for calls in the next few weeks. I do enjoy buying the dip on these. . . No derivatives on stocks now except my puts on $TSLA still.</content>

      <content>5th March Update:Gonna close at 38. 8k or put a trailing stop loss when it gets there. Essentially trailing SL means if it breaks abover 38. 8k we TP. $TSLA looking for close on puts at 770-773. Same thing, can put trailing SL. Let it run if it can but be prepared to take profit at support! Don&amp;#x27;t think we get a big big move down just yet. One more consolidation!</content>

      <content>For $BTC I think the lowest we can go to me is 36. 5-36. 8 in the short time frame. Don&amp;#x27;t think we go down too deep just yet. But even then I think we do a final wick back up above 40k to aim for D before going down. D would be around 41. 2-41. 8 imo. You can take some profits and then reshort or just hold the short down. I think either way, i&amp;#x27;ll still be holding some shorts down as I expect lower for $BTC eventually! As long as you get paid in funding, nothing to worry about for holding shorts.</content>

I do think we see deeper but not before some possible relief to 40-41k, even if we do go deeper, I am fine adding to my longs at 38. 6k since this is small. In a down market I am not buying on leverage. For US Stocks essentially nothing to buy yet. Just watch the open. . . don&amp;#x27;t think there&amp;#x27;s significant support since this is approaching the second tap of support! Wait it out a few days. . .</content>

      <content>$ROKU is worth less today than it was worth before the pandemic. Yet, relative to its pre-pandemic levels, Roku has 60% more users, 145% more revenues and 13X the EBITDA. It indeed looks like we&amp;#x27;re free falling but on a technical standpoint we&amp;#x27;re at long-standing support. Above this, yes, revenue misses due to supply chain issues from the pandemic in the q4 earnings are a point of concern. However, this can be relatively easily fixed over time as governments start learning to live with COVID. This just depends on the industry. &amp;quot;Based on the likelihood that a meaningful portion of the $60bn-$70bn of traditional TV advertising market will migrate to connected TV platforms in the coming years, we have maintained our modest sized position during this period of tempered viewership growth. &amp;quot;Long-term still think it has potential. Very high on my radar. Actually punting a few calls soon. Since we&amp;#x27;re also on a Technical Support at 100-110</content>

Bullish on Commodities (Personally haven&amp;#x27;t bought much) Still expanding into this asset class on my personal portfolio diversification. Mainly looking at ETFs/Indexes.</content>

      <content>Possible close for $TSLA at 878-928 already laddered. . . For the time being, just using a trailing stop loss. Think we get a decent rally out of this FOMC news. Hearing just over yesterday, nothing too crazy just a 25 percentage point move.</content>

      <content>19th March Update:Most stocks on a major run-up today specifically $SHOP, $CLOV, $ABNB, $TSLA all still doing well.  I am just taking profits for $TSLA and $ABNB. Did not take any positions for the others. Still think there is a bit more upside for most counters. But I won&amp;#x27;t be a buyer for those that already did 20-30% in the last couple of days. Feds did a very low interest rate hike and Powell basically suggested that the Economy is still strong. I don&amp;#x27;t believe we reach ATH this year still. If you want a decent R:R play that hasn&amp;#x27;t flew yet, I might look at $ROKU on Monday, currently at 124. Will look for puts starting end of next week I think!</content>

      <content>Just broke down into 42. 3k again. . . My average sells were about 43. 2k. Took only about 400k in Contract Positions but happy with the entry. Generally I don&amp;#x27;t tend to shorts add along the way down, I add shorts only on the way up. Always remember, buy on dumps, sell on pumps. Simple logic! Will place a tight stop loss on the short here at 42. 6k, which I expect will trigger but I am okay with taking profits at this support even though I still possibly expect 38. 6-39. 3k. It&amp;#x27;s just risk-management.</content>

      <content>$TSLA is flying. Ladder in slowly if you are going puts. We did retrace to 970 on market open. Not intending to fade this market open. Luckily I have some $ROKU and $FSLY and $CLOV. $CLOV made one of the biggest moves, almost a 2x already from last week. I would expect $BTC to run alongside stocks given the market conditions so I am just going to trade within the numbers I gave yesterday, but tighter as the wedge consolidations.</content>

      <content>Crypto, particularly $BTC is quite slow right now. . . Might have to look into some alts. So for instance, if we are trading on support at 42. 3-42. 5k, and resistance at 42. 7-43. 1k, the next time it bounces off there we shift both support and resistance tighter by a margin of 0. 786 based on fibo. But bear in mind this is a smaller triangle within the larger wedge. I&amp;#x27;d just take these trades if I were day trading. Still in my 43. 2k shorts but closing some more to de-risk. Will re-short higher, possibly at 42. 8-42. 9k.</content>

      <content>27th March Update: Waiting for the Market Open still on the TSLA put options. Think this is still in an area of resistance. Managed to average out my previous shorts and deleverage. Still holding some shorts but I am still averaging in slowly. I still am on the belief we are not recovering into a full-blown bull market. I think the macro conditions have improved with the low interest rate hikes but given the upcoming FOMC hearings and hikes. Don‚Äôt think we get ATH for $BTC or $TSLA like some are suggesting. In this scenario, I would just be going low leverage/margin for shorts and puts and waiting for it to truly bottom before buying heavily. It‚Äôs hard to time the top but I don‚Äôt believe we have bottomed so still biased down. Tomorrow onwards also going to be providing some analysis on FX markets, will share more details on this later but largely the NY times. Been backtesting for awhile and trading on a smaller size but the trading style will be daily and different from the Crypto/Stocks one. You can follow along with this log for this as well if you are interested in FX. If you&amp;#x27;re new to FX markets, have a guide coming soon too so don&amp;#x27;t worry!</content>

Still, until I receive confirmation that price wants to go up from my demand zones marked out in the form of (1) a change of character (CHoCH) or (2) 2 Higher Highs formed, I will still be entertaining quick shorts from my 1H supply area as Price is still bearish in 4H substructure.</content>

(Overall +11. 7%)After putting in a series of Higher highs today, the price narrative is now confirmed bullish so as of now we can look to long the market again from the new M15 Demand zone. The potential take profit areas will be the new M15 Supply zone above (conservative) &amp;amp; the current 4H high at 1. 1370 (aggressive). Still, I will be wary of a reversal to the downside as price had created a trendline of liquidity (aka stop loss orders waiting to be taken out) on its way up.</content>

      <content>29th March Crypto Update:$BTC Shorts at 47955 laddered slowly, SL around 48085-48250. Possible we wick through 48k but I think we will retrace later today. These are shorter time frame swing trades possible 1-2 days. Targeting closes on support for a safe exit at 47550-47585, potentially 47155-47255. Shift SL in TP after maybe an hour.</content>

      <content>Generally for Stops it depends on your risk tolerance. Normally I will put a range &amp;amp; then this one is up to your own discretion. I am inclined to advise laddering slower and having a healthier stop loss so you have room to breathe. We should still be heading down since we got rejected so just sticking with the plan üëåüèº</content>

      <content>29th March FX updateEUR/USD 4HPrice has pushed up significantly without getting to our buy area (M15 Demand zone) and now it is currently facing rejection from the 4H Structural Highs. Narrative is still bullish but Price is too high to get in a long at nearby buy areas right now. However, if Price changes character to bearish on M15 time frame at the current rejection area, we can get ready to find areas to get in some quick sells instead.</content>

      <content>Put ladders for short closes at 47555-47585 to take profit for the safe TP region (50% close is fine too, up to you), once we break under 47630 put a stop limit (trigger price 47630, limit price 47650) at that price so even when we shoot back up you can immediately take profit but give it the chance to run down as well.</content>

      <content>29th March FX Update:Price seems to be rejecting off from 4H structural highs here after price changes character (CHoCH) to temporary bearish state. Thus, Sells are now valid from both M15 Supply zones (with lower time frames confirmation) and can look to target 1st take profit level 1 and leave some runners until M15 Demand Zone at the bottom.</content>

      <content>Look for the second TP right now at 47185-47255 as I mentioned, market extremely volatile today. You can also flip a long here at D with the SL mentioned around 46. 8. Roughly we are going to be playing this range, since we got a big move yesterday.</content>

      <content>Close TP is around 47185, flip long is about 47125-47165 I think. Put an SL below and play the range. My stance is to play the range from A, B, C, D, E waves but be quicker to cut longs with an SL and be more willing to hold shorts with a more flexible buffer at this region. I think after the consolidation wedge forms we will break down back under 46/47k in the long-term view.</content>

      <content>EUR/USD FX update:Would have gotten stopped out by 2 pips if entered a short at the first supply zone. I personally did not enter the trade as price action on the lower time frames (1minute) was not very clean. To me, the Supply zone at the top is still valid to trade from as there is a build up of liquidity just right below it. Not much opportunities today as price looks like it is currently in an indecision phase for tonight&amp;#x27;s NY session so we stay cash. Still up over 10RR on the week, going to stay patient. As for concerns on how to go about trading this strategy effectively for FX and others too, a new guide will be coming out soon so not to worry!</content>

In that whole range I gave previously, use your longs to ladder out into flips short much deeper in. Just exit and take profits first.

We can look to scalp some quick longs from the 2 valid demand zones if price comes into it and changes character to bullish in the zone on the M15. Will provide an update if that happens, then we can start opening longs from valid demand zones. But looking at the big picture for EUR/USD, we want to see if price can come into our 4H supply zone soon &amp;amp; reject from there to continue EUR/USD&amp;#x27;s bearish run on the Higher time frame narrative.</content>

      <content>Just my 2 cents, you can also opt to put a trailing SL under 45. 7k in a bit like I mentioned. . . so basically we let it run down and give it the chance to, but be ready to take profits since we close to my support regions already. I expect there to be some relief soon. I&amp;#x27;ll at least close majority when we get into 45315-45511 and flip a small long with a tight SL. If all these methodologies seem confusing for you. Not to worry. . . Going to release a series of videos on a new website on how to specifically ladder &amp;amp; place SLs soon. Existing users in this chat will get it free.

I think part of the problem of doing these short-term trades is that I lose sight of the bigger picture. Was attempting to re-short but didn&amp;#x27;t fill cause I fell asleep.

      <content>1st April Forex EUR/USD UpdateTo be honest, not much happening right now across major fx pairs, many of them have just been consolidating and stuck in a range. However, I did spot an interesting setup on EU pair on the M15, where we may see price take out trendline liquidity and sell off from a clean 1H point of interest. Other than that, will just be waiting for a breakout of this range for tonight&amp;#x27;s session before looking for a trade/directional bias.</content>

So can opt for a safe TP there but this short can possibly let it run. R:R here is 1:3 risking a $300 upside move for at least $900 down to take profit.</content>

      <content>In all honesty, even though I didn&amp;#x27;t close at the exact bottom at 44. 2k, taking the short from 47. 7k to 45. 5k is good enough. After trading for awhile, I know better than to hold a position too long or adjust my profit regions too much. It&amp;#x27;s a good thing we took the day break as it flew back to 47k earlier today as well. Just got back into my short here. Will start monday off with a stocks update!</content>

      <content>3 April Crypto Update: Off the bat, i&amp;#x27;m looking at 45255-45415 as a decent area of support. Long Run we should probably test 43 lows still, hypothetically 43. 2-43. 4k, but i&amp;#x27;ll put a trailing SL rather than take profits sometimes as I believe the overarching trend (like big big trend) is still down for the time being.

      <content>4th April Crypto &amp;amp; Stocks Update:I am still holding on to my shorts. Not really concerned with this movement. Think we‚Äôre going to be ranging here once again for a couple days. I‚Äôll be taking shorts at resistance but no longs on supports. Think the trend is down on a mid-term time frame. I‚Äôm still in my short so not re-shorting‚Ä¶Both 46355 and 46785-46855 are the resistances for this range. I‚Äôll probably opt to close some at 45030-45155. But I‚Äôll hold some for even lower. Looking at macro conditions with Interest Rate Hikes next month looming. Potentially we could revisit 41. 3-41. 7k again. $TSLA as I mentioned in the other group we should see some re-tracement down to 1030 but I don‚Äôt see any cause of concern in the next few weeks for any lower than that. I am just not buying calls at these prices right now though.</content>

      <content>4th April Commodities &amp;amp; Forex:The global economy is still largely affected by rising inflation rates so its a good time to look at safe haven assets like gold, although gains will be modest. It also  just bounced right off a strong fibonacci level at 1890 last week. I will be bullish if it can continue to go up, preferbly past the 1965 levels. For this week&amp;#x27;s outlook on EUR/USD, all I am interested in now is for price to break out of the range it is in before establishing a directional bias. Other than that, a crucial price level to look at for price to make a huge reversal up to new structural highs will be at 1. 10050 to 1. 09700. Will be monitoring price action in that zone closely.</content>

      <content>4th April Forex EUR/USD UpdateAs predicted on the weekly outlook earlier today, Price is now approaching an extreme point of interest/Demand Zone. (Meaning the gains could be quite huge depending on how long you want to hold the trade - normally I would take partials to end the night and leave runners for higher take profit levels)So for tonight&amp;#x27;s session, both zones are valid to take a trade from. But for a higher probability trade, wait for price to perform a Change of Character (CHoCH) on the M5 or M15 time frame</content>

      <content>11th April Crypto Update:Current Price 43. 1k, where we got stopped out at entry the previous time. I don&amp;#x27;t mind a re-long attempt here. Reason I chose to just get stopped out and not hold the long is because I don&amp;#x27;t want the stress of holding an underwater long position throughout the weekend anyway. However, I think this is a second opportunity to catch a move for a squeeze up. I do think we are going to squeeze out some shorts tomorrow. We will have to tap liquidity above 44k at least once before going down. Regions for long close and/or flip short would be 44035-44068 (Likely)I will go for re-shorts at both of these resistance but with a strategy of laddering in both entries and putting a stop loss at entry after each rejection. No matter what I would want to hold a short into the upcoming FOMC hearing I feel.</content>

      <content>Did exit all of my $TSLA I bought at $780 earlier at $970-1010 and took small puts at 1080. Will close later and be a buyer once I chart where it bottoms. . . Sometimes its good to step away, I have been ignoring stocks for awhile cause I already took profits and it ran slightly away without me. Just being patient!</content>

      <content>For Crypto:Current $BTC Price: 40. 2kI honestly think we get a relief move up before a continuation downwards, it&amp;#x27;s just very dangerous to long here with the global conditions. However, if you want you can punt a small long. I would prefer to wait for 42. 8k and above to start laddering in shorts. Otherwise just holding in cash. For Stocks:Most Counters haven&amp;#x27;t reached a floor yet. Think $TSLA needs to test the 800s region to get a strong proper bounce. Can hold the $1080 puts further. Generally be buying at least 2-4 months on your expirations if you can afford it. Easier to hold this way!</content>

      <content>It is a bank holiday so thought I would share some educational content for you guys instead on why I also use the &amp;quot;Smart Money Concept&amp;quot; (SMC) to trade (fx) markets. Take a read to improve your understanding to why the market moves the way it does!To prevent confusion, the retail trading pattern / support resistance levels DO WORK, but in my experience one has to go a little deeper than just simple support and resistance lines to be able to trade off them effectively &amp;amp; SMC is a great way to help yourself understand why price moves the way it does instead of just thinking we got manipulated when trades don&amp;#x27;t go our way. If interested, more resources are available on our site for you guys!</content>

For Stocks;$SHOP &amp;amp; $CLOV being hammered while $TSLA finds some relief finally. Not a terrible price now for a $TSLA put at $1004.

New York sessions at night have been kinda bad the last month or so in terms of number of high probability setups. . But markets do get boring in stretches at times so not to worry, more setups will be coming eventually.

      <content>Next FOMC hearing is on June 15-16. Till then I think we range for US Stocks &amp;amp; Crypto. . Potential swing longs soon at the low 800s for $TSLA!I am also not in total agreement that I/R hikes can go super high because the US Gov would then not be able to afford the I/R payments on the $30 Trillion National Debt, which is soon to be $100 Trillion. The Feds unfortunately have no choice but to keep I/R management within the 25-50 basis point range and taper it accordingly. Sure, the citizens have to suffer inflation but bringing it down too fast would cause the bankruptcy of the state if they can&amp;#x27;t pay sovereign debt off.</content>

      <content>Feb 29th US Stocks Update:Moving day. Closing $TSLA puts here at 865-870, flipping into calls temporarily - Waiting for a double bottom to form and for one more sweep of the lows to enter into calls 840-865 is a decent region to DCA calls with a flexible SL. Early on our SL has to be more flexible before switching to a trailing SL once we get profits. I think there&amp;#x27;s still time till the hearing and the interest rates hikes will be tapered slowly. Won&amp;#x27;t see an immediate market crash.</content>

      <content>Regarding the call options for $TSLA here. I do believe we see a relief rally into 900s for $TSLA but my belief is that the extenuating trend is still down. Once we get 900s I will watch very closely for a close. Off the bat, once I am fully in my positions I am going to put TP targets from 988-1028 and a loose trailing SL at 900 and once we get above 950 an extremely tight trailing SL. I am honestly happy with taking profits quickly for calls in a bearish market or recession climate.</content>

      <content>Not sure why I kept posting so many updates about a double bottom sweep for $TSLA and second guessed myself so much. I initially just wanted to enter lumpsum at 865, waiting for another sweep to $840 is just foolhardy and unnecessary. Not much difference when we waited so long for these prices. Now my average is about 870 instead of 865 but whatever. . . -,-Fully in my buy call postitions already here anyway, holding till $900 at least. Will stop pussyfooting.

      <content>We indeed only had 1 proper tap above 42. 7k for $BTC üòÖ Still in the short!Reason why I am still in this $BTC short: I want to protect this short as best I can. Sure, I can attempt to predict a support and re-short higher to increase profits BUT I am hesistant we get a lot of good bounces along the way down since there is no significant support region. Less stressful for me just holding it down and actively taking profits at each support with the percentage of TP depending on the strength of the support. Increased activity may come with increased profits but it also comes with increased stress. Learnt this the hard way in the past when I fat fingered large contracts. I am a day trader on some days depending on the setup but this larger time frame swing trading is a style that works for me. Higher probabilistic wins. Perhaps less profit. but less leverage. less button pushing. less stress.</content>

      <content>üí• bang $TSLA still holding strong! Good close on the puts yesterday at $865 to flip long and into calls. Loose SL at $900 and a tighter one as we approach $950. Been pretty good on my trades still! Hope all is good on your ends as well! Still happy taking profits. Will take some profits at both resistances cause I don&amp;#x27;t like buying too much in this market. . .</content>

      <content>Got stopped out of $TSLA positions last  night at $900. Also did say to take some profits at these resistances as well. Still think we&amp;#x27;re in a down-trend. Unfortunately didn&amp;#x27;t get in my re-shorts. . . Same as crypto I would prefer to just hold the position down instead of trying to time and buy. These bounces are to be honest too insignificant.</content>

      <content>FOMC Hearing will be on May 3/4th, expecting a down market for the quarter. Still looking for re-opening of puts for $TSLA as well as holding my BTC short. Not adding to shorts just holding the initial. Closed my $860 call at $900 a couple days back so looking for puts now. If we get to 930-950 for $TSLA i&amp;#x27;m actually going to be opening put options.</content>

      <content>Laddering in some small puts here at $905 maybe 20-30% first for $TSLA. I think we&amp;#x27;re heavily reliant on the hearing news and although the possibility of a 50-75 basis point hike has already largely been priced into the market, I still think Powell might have more instore &amp;amp; choice words for us so expect volatility tomorrow.</content>

      <content>For Forex especially, major pairs have just been consolidating hard the past few days at HTF Point of Interests. This is Financial Institutions just waiting for post-FOMC tonight to bring prices to the levels they are looking at. We may see a bullish reversal here but really we just have wait for them to show their hands and react accordingly (we don&amp;#x27;t predict). So no fx trades for now!</content>

      <content>Hi guys! Some updates: Will be shifting all current existing members to discord and opening this group up to the public by tomorrow. This group henceforth will be used for more broad time frame market trading update and to share specific options and derivatives strategies. As well as serve as a open public track record log of my previous few trades. Livestreams henceforth will be done on Discord - (https://discord. gg/gF6Pu6wB). I prefer to use discord because there are bots there to moderate members, facilitate discussions and also will be doing livestreams there!If you&amp;#x27;re an existing member: Not to worry, if you don&amp;#x27;t know how to use Discord, i&amp;#x27;ll send you an email invite to the private discord channel tomorrow anyway. If you&amp;#x27;re a new member: will re-open slots to the livestream group on a private discord channel once I set everything up.</content>

      <content>Just a quick update on the short set-ups raised last night for EUR/USD (Forex). Price did come up and reacted well. If you entered using the M1 for confirmation, would already be up 10RR  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBut anyways, also want to say if you are in the trade, best to take some partials now or at least set SL at BE.

      <content>Let me try and explain something here:You got bottom liquidation levels at 32. 6k for $BTC and 2404 for $ETH according to hyblockcapital. com After that the delta is quite red. What does this mean?We&amp;#x27;re getting quite close to a region of support. From what I understand, it means there&amp;#x27;s no more money to be made from liquidating sizeable longers after that number - so any further selling after that has to be made from spot selling. The question you have to ask yourself is will price action be dictated by the futures or spot market. Generally, the former has control because futures volume is multitudes bigger than spot. However, if there is a flight to safety and spot just gives up and dumps, then who props up the futures price? This normally is in the prerogative of the exchange to hold prices steady - using something called the Insurance Fund. Anyway, i&amp;#x27;ll try explain this concept sometime. TLDR; we got no one left to kill below this price point so if we drop it has to be spot dumping, but a very possible relief region coming soon.</content>

      <content>only left my 10% in shorts left, rest are in stables since november last year as you guys know. i think in this market, as long as you are not losing money &amp;amp; you got some ammo to buy the dip later on - you&amp;#x27;ll be fine. i will deploy the mother load and start scaling in my dry powder in Q3 i presume. for now, i believe for $BTC we are going to break down below 30k and look towards 28k for a close on the final shorts and small flip longs. exact numbers later!very heavy market these few days. . . i&amp;#x27;m not going to be a fudder, but macro conditions are really bad, there will be some crypto alts that will go close to zero. I still believe in stocks - things like $TSLA $AAPL are still good long term investments.</content>

      <content>when i say crypto alts that will go close to zero - i think things that did a massive run-up last year like ($LUNA, $SOL) with eroding utility or a poor protocol construct are at wayyy biggest risk than things like an large exchange token ($BNB, $FTT). just fyi, i&amp;#x27;m still in my tiny bit of shorts. i changed my stance and will not be entering into longs here at 28k. this is not a market i want to be longing or buying yet. i do believe we see lower in Q3 - if we get a full-blown recession - my exact figures are much deeper - always have been. hope everyone is safe!</content>

      <content>Not too much has changed for the crypto market since my last update. But on the side of forex markets,  the EUR/USD pair is looking bearish again after a strong &amp;amp; complex pullback the last couple of weeks &amp;amp; now there&amp;#x27;s relatively clean areas of interests for shorts. [technical analysis]We can thus expect price to potentially react in the areas marked and if it does, shorts will be in play.</content>

      <content>Plan still the same as I drew in 4th March! We&amp;#x27;re still looking at 18-23k as a keen point of interest. I did close a fair bit but still in some of my original puts since 48k there. I&amp;#x27;ll consider closing my put options there!

      <content>Over on the forex markets, going into July, the EUR/USD pair seems to be showing signs of reversal to the upside now, after my call for shorts from 1. 077 levels earlier this month which played out well. The bias now will be for one final move down before price potentially reverses. So will look for price to give us some tells &amp;amp; areas to long after the major news play out at the start of July. But if price does not bounce out of key support levels well, look for the pair to continue its HTF narrative down.</content>

After last night&amp;#x27;s move up, structure on the bigger picture is unconfirmed bullish.

      <content>Forex update 26/7: EUR/USDAn update on the overall movement EUR/USD. Since last week&amp;#x27;s call for price to drop down to 1. 011 levels (Marked in blue arrow), price has consolidated for awhile before finally approaching the targeted levels. Did catch a 14RR short following the trend last week but other than that &amp;amp; a short today during London&amp;#x27;s session (didn&amp;#x27;t take), there weren&amp;#x27;t any high probability setups for me to share during the consolidation. .

      <content>28th July FOMC Update:So we just got our 75 basis points hike in the FOMC Hearing a couple minutes ago. Powell has pivoted to a more dovish stance, hinting to taper back hikes on a meeting by meeting basis in the case if CPI &amp;amp; PCE remain softer in the next few months - which is why we see this push up across the board. My opinion still remains that CPI &amp;amp; PCE won&amp;#x27;t be controlled with such a &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot; hike and Powell will still have to continue cooling off the market; tldr: bear trend continues till inflation is properly controlled. Not really looking at new entries for puts and re-shorts, still holding my original ones. In other news, $META just missed earnings in this latest tech earnings; this might be one to look out for that I believe still has deeper to go if they keep self-sabotaging the platform with their poor acquisitions and restructuring.</content>

However, I only trade New York sessions at night so I missed it. Still, will be looking for price to break the highs now with or without a temporary pullback to 1. 012 area.

      <content>Crypto Update August 2022:$BTC price right now is ranging between 23-24k, I am still in the belief that the recession isn‚Äôt over and we have yet to establish strong enough lows for a reversal. That being said, I think there is some upside here to tap liquidity. Considering we have until September 20-21 to the next hearing, barring that there is not extenuating bad news or war crisis the next few months, we can hope to tap 29. 5-31. 1k as a proper resistance before continuation of the downtrend on Crypto. As of now, if I had longs, I would consider closing at 24. 9-25. 1k or place a tight stop there and let it run up to that bigger resistance region. Above that point, if you want to take a safer R:R longer-term play, ladder in shorts slowly up to 29. 5-31. 1k. The reason I am only analysing $BTC is because I think it is still the market leaders and alts will still correspond to $BTC price movement. Will only touch alts at a larger area of interest, not in a low volume area. These are of course larger swing move plays and not meant for a day-trading style.

      <content>Crypto Update August 2022 (Part 2)Getting to my first region of 24. 9k-25. 1k, on longs right now you can consider running a tight stop loss after tomorrow to see if this region holds. I&amp;#x27;d wait for tomorrow&amp;#x27;s reaction and the global markets to open. If we successfully break this region, I am of course looking at my next PoC at 29. 5-31. 1k where I will be flipping into shorts once again with some size. A lot of this move is fuelled by the lower than expected inflationary pressures that the Feds have &amp;quot;successfully&amp;quot; managed to curtail &amp;amp; contain.

      <content>Forex EUR/USD updateSo an update, yesterday&amp;#x27;s trade was fully closed out at a total of +8. 6% (20% runner closed out at 23RR). For now, the main target is still to break the low of 0. 99 but the internal structure is kind of just trading sideways if we zoom out to see thus there isn&amp;#x27;t really any strong directional bias at the moment. So for today, would only entertain a quick short if my pattern drawn out, plays out. Trade Forex at XM with $50 bonus credit</content>

      <content>Gold (XUA/USD) just broke the historical support level of 1680 late last week as predicted two weeks back. Will be interesting to see how things unfold on the chart after the news release on Fed&amp;#x27;s September interest rate hikes on Sep 21. The way the charts are lining up , I am inclined to think that Fed&amp;#x27;s may soon opt for 1/2 100 bps rate hike to tackle inflation more aggressively, and then we should see safe-haven assets like Gold start to climb back up after huge dumps during the rate hikes.

      <content>Forex EUR/USD update: This afternoon, price broke the target low with a strong impulsive move to the downside, just like how we mapped it out yesterday night!Price is hovering around a critical support area now so won&amp;#x27;t be trading until we get a strong move away from here, especially with FOMC reports coming in at 2am tonight.

      <content>For EUR/USD, the obvious trend is down now after last week‚Äôs FOMC but what we can look for right now is a complex pullback up into the 1. 00 parity level (Also a nice confluence is the 62/70 fibs level at 1. 00).

      <content>Updated outlook on EUR/USD. Price wasn&amp;#x27;t able to get a strong enough reaction yesterday to continue down from my zones. . but its ok we adjust and move on. Still, there were 2 valid quick scalps to get into from my zones if we traded this afternoon. . but the lesson/point that I want to share here is that we do not have to catch the full 100RR moves that we so often see on social media to be profitable in trading (especially day trading). In fact, a lot of profitable traders out there only try to catch a 1 to 5 RR trades &amp;amp; close their positions no matter how much further the trade could go in their favour. Find a consistent strategy that works for you, is profitable in the long run &amp;amp; stick to it! (Or you can just wait for our free trading PDF that&amp;#x27;s launching soon ü§´)</content>

At this point, no TA needed. no FA needed. Just wait for the significant parties to tweet, or write a script if you have to, and trade based of that.

      <content>9th November Crypto/Stocks Update:This is more of a post-mortem update. I am sure some of you guys might be affected by the markets and know someone who got hit as well. I have taken a small loss, albeit still sizeable as well. We move on. I do think there is still downside to this market on both stocks and crypto. Notable counters would be looking at the support at $130-150 for $TSLA, a quick wick under $10,000 for $BTC and under $800 for $ETH have all been in consideration for me. I posted these thoughts on Twitter months ago if you want to go take a look. Best to be careful with your funds on CEXs for now, as the contagion and repercussions of the recent events unfold. A lot of this has to do with the 3AC implosion, causing Alameda, Genesis, Jump all to face insolvency and requiring bailouts causing the liquidity crisis in Crypto. For stocks, most earnings are dismal, we did see a run-up as expected into midterms. We only have a plausible Santa Claus rally coming but be cautious training into such headwinds.

      <content>EUR/USD outlook for the week/in the medium term. With expectations that inflation has peaked, the Euro was able to finally break its previous macro high (&amp;amp; critical parity level) against the USD. Still, loads of liquidity lies below 1. 00 &amp;amp; I wouldn&amp;#x27;t be surprised if price does a final trace back all the way down to 1. 00 or 0. 96 level again before continuing its supposed bull trend.  Any buys right now would have to still involve conservative take profit levels.</content>

      <content>18th November Market Update:Some key price supports I am looking at; At the moment, we should expect a Santa Claus Rally or some stability in the markets this next month; I still think we resume the bearish downtrend in Q1 2023, I will ladder in long-term DTE bearish options strategy on $SPY, we&amp;#x27;re right at the resistance right now 4100 to 4200 is key (Video coming soon on this I promise). If you want to take a ride up, this santa claus rally, $ABNB is a possible opportunity right now at under $100. I see travel resuming, the property market cooling and the rental market to still be fluid and liquid. In terms of cashflow, I think they will still be a good investment as we make our way in 2023. Even if the general market goes up, I think $TSLA might still go down in the short-term considering the shaky news there, along with a weakening TA indicators, either case, I think 115-145 presents a very good buying opportunity there if we get there. I&amp;#x27;ll ladder in on the day and update. For Crypto, I am still expecting a 8-10k $BTC target eventually but completely removing my exposure on  CEXs for the time being. I am shorting on XM (Link in Pinned Message) but a small amount only. My rationale is that opening derivatives on a non-crypto based company removes the risk of a bankrun or an exchange not honouring if Crypto does face insolvency or a liquidity crunch. This is my current take but it will evolve as we get to our next FOMC Hearing!</content>

      <content>20th November Market Update:So PPI data has just been released November 16, indicating a slower than expected producer price increase. We are starting to see inflation being controlled and rate hikes slowing down. All this in a positive earnings environment. We have also just seen a run-up to 4000+ on the SPY. Do we still have leg-room for more?I think yes. We remain in a relatively stable period this Q4 as we approach a prospective Santa Claus Rally. Are we still in a recessionary environment?Also yes, but it&amp;#x27;s largely been priced in and I think this next year is for buying. Perhaps not the S&amp;amp;P directly as we might revisit lows but I don&amp;#x27;t believe we go much deeper (At most 3300 range). Even them, there are several distressed assets already at multi technical lows worth considering soon; $TSLA $BTC $ABNB $GOOGL, yes even $META. There&amp;#x27;s not much more lower these can go and I think Q1 2023 is time to start laddering in. In the meantime, I will still taking shorter term trades.

      <content>8th December 2022Current markets are indeed boring I must admit, but this place of ranging is quite a good place to practise some smaller day trading positions. Current PA for $SPY looks like we rejected off the 4100 as I mentioned quite nicely. Have already flipped into some puts. For Crypto, we look to be developing a wedge on $BTC. You can play the resistance at 16800-16900 and the support at 16100-16300 for a few scalps I think the next couple of days. Also selling CFDs on SOL/USD. I have switched to XM on MT5 currently for my day trading account using CFDs (Essentially the same thing as Futures but i&amp;#x27;ll do a video on this soon).

      <content>12th December 2022 Update:Current Positions are a $BTC short and $TSLA long. I almost always only trade $BTC for Crypto. Do note, this is my speculative account which I only started with 1000 USD in December after the FTX crash. Aiming to get this to 10000 USD in a month or so. No fixed timeline. Follow at your own risk. This account is for my degeneracy. I am also doing bear call spreads and perhaps credit spreads with my larger main account with options. I‚Äôll share on that later. Current Price targets for $BTC:Short-Term: 15. 9k-16. 3k SupportLong-Term: 8-12k SupportCurrent Price targets for $TSLA:Hoping to form a swing failure bottom and push for the $210 area.

      <content>Starting Balance 10/12: 1000 USDCurrent Balance 12/12: 2000~ USDClosed off yesterday&amp;#x27;s BTC Short from 17. 2k for a nice profit ($528 USD, 1st Image). Currently on a long from 16. 8k (2nd Image) as I expect a dead cat bounce once US Markets open just based on the SPY E-Minis having some upwards pressure. Actually closed open and closed these trades closer to the the top and bottom than it looks. Do note that the buy/sell spread is about 0. 001%. Wasn&amp;#x27;t a perfect exit as I am still getting used to the spreads on CFDs. This might not sound great at first but with CFDs, I don&amp;#x27;t mind the wider spread cause there are zero commission and fees and markets are less wickish as compared to futures. Also I don&amp;#x27;t trust CEXs right now. I&amp;#x27;ll do an exchange/derivative comparison overview for my next video.</content>

      <content>Short-term target for $BTC still think we need to tap and watch the 15. 9k-16. 3k Support. If that breaks, we go into goblin town. However, I don&amp;#x27;t expect the long term support at 8-12k to be reached so soon. Based on my extension models, I think more likely to be in Feb-June 2023. As of now, these are just good setups to swing trade.</content>

      <content>Pardon for the lack of updates recently here! But volumes are just so low in Dec that there&amp;#x27;s just not much high probability &amp;amp; high RR (risk-to-reward) trade setups, especially if you trade Futures. But here&amp;#x27;s an outlook on EUR/USD where it looks like it may give a final tap at critical levels of 1. 07 before going down for a pullback in this macro bullish leg. But at the end of the day, what we are all trading now really just depends on inflation and wage prints so take this opportunity when market is quiet to read up on these things!</content>

      <content>JUST IN TODAY: Consumer Price Index (CPI) Y/Y: 6. 5% , accurate to analysts&amp;#x27; expectations. As a result, we are seeing some bullish momentum in the markets right now but negligible as this CPI print may have already been priced in with all the bullish price action we have been seeing recently. (The only scenario the market was going down is if CPI came in higher than expected). Still, the markets have just been going up too heavily without any healthy pullbacks so i&amp;#x27;m expecting the environment to turn bearish for awhile soon. Might be a good time to start hunting for short set-ups.</content>

      <content>Forex EUR/USD outlookI think everyone probably knows by now that Market is bullish. But as I&amp;#x27;ve mentioned in the previous weeks, the bulls currently seems to be getting weaker &amp;amp; weaker, especially in EUR/USD. &amp;amp; there&amp;#x27;s just no nice levels to long from at the moment imo. So this might be a week where I start getting into counter-trend shorts (If there&amp;#x27;s strong confirmation) &amp;amp; potentially holding these positions for awhile, possibly catching the entire down move of a macro pullback, which has been long overdue.

      <content>For EUR/USD, bulls are starting to show signs of exhaustion here, even with the favourable PCE news today. How do we tell? Traders can make use of candlestick patterns on the chart. For eg if we see multiple wicks beyond a certain point, it is an early sign of a possible reversal as the market isn&amp;#x27;t strong enough to push price impulsively to close beyond a certain level. (Of course, will still need other confluences to strengthen your bias)But anyways an update, in our selected zone on Jan 16th, 3 clean short setups were available (but weren&amp;#x27;t taken due to CNY events. . )  Still macro bullish though, so taking partial profits/trailing SL is recommended for any counter trend shorts now.

      <content>US JAN. CORE PCE PRICE INDEX RISES 4. 7% Y/Y; EST. 4. 3%A lot to digest from but i&amp;#x27;ll try to break it down. Basically what this means is that we have to either keep rates sustained at 25 bps for longer (while implies prolonged pain &amp;amp; a slower drawdown). If we push up to 50 bps, this would be disastrous - when the rhetoric has now been to try keep at 25 bps and aim for a soft landing. My best bet is that it keeps the 25 bps hike but Powell suggests to raise the 2% inflation target &amp;amp; we just have to begin accepting higher prices and the destruction of our savings.</content>

      <content>Nothing too clean to look at for Forex atm so maybe just some quick thoughts on Crypto. Both BTC &amp;amp; ETH are struggling to close bullish above previous highs on the higher time frame charts &amp;amp; that tends to signify to me that bulls are either out of strength and we are ready to go down for awhile OR we are due for one final spike up to liquidate retail investors before a big dump. Atm 21. 2k to 20. 9k is critical for BTC to hold &amp;amp; ETH&amp;#x27;s is at 1. 5k. Any lower, we can expect further dumps (Looking at 18. 2k &amp;amp; 1350 respectively. ) When will it happen?

      <content>Pardon my colloquial speaking, sharing this for learning purposes. Had a friend earlier ask me if it&amp;#x27;s still worth to short here. At the prices earlier today, I argued that it would be better off selling direct puts for $TSLA at 135-140. Of course, this depends on the time frame you are looking at. To have such sufficient premium, these credits have to be accrued over a much larger time frame. However, with FOMC coming up next week (May 2) I would either ladder in slowly, and stack there depending on the data. In other news, I will be doing some basic trading group lessons for free next month just to collect some testimonials but this will be limited slots for now due to my time constraints. (ps. I am also still learning as I go alongüôÇ)</content>

      <content>What is ADP and is it significant towards the upcoming Govt NFP data?Generally ADP is a smaller sample sized benchmark to the upcoming NFP data. Historically, ADP has come in lower 9/11 times compared to NFP. With this figure 142k about the forecast, this foreshadows another NFP beat. To put things rudimentarily, if the job market is still strong, this gives Powell leeway to hike once more into the FOMC, however I don&amp;#x27;t think it will be more than the 25 basis points into the 5. 25 FFR forecasted tomorrow. Likely just a longer slower bleed, we will keep staying at this range till something breaks.</content>

      <content>How do we trade FOMC tomorrow? As always, the guidance is more important. If he pushes the rhethoric for longer sustained rates and opts to not pause (I think this possibly happens given the NFP data), we get a push down to low 400s on $SPY and heavier drawdowns on growth stocks. It&amp;#x27;s important to note tech, growth and banking sectors are not correlated. Higher rates might still be beneficial for bigger banks contingent if firesales and bailouts keep happening as we recently saw. Don&amp;#x27;t think crypto or gold crashes, floor is clearly established barring no black swan event. Still doing bullish spreads or outright spot holdings on Gold as I think we are in a ranging kangaroo market, no point going heavy leverage here. Also like bearish credit spreads on $QQQ, I think there&amp;#x27;s more premiums as compared to $SPY. Will live trade tomorrow.</content>

      <content>How do we approach CPI?CPI tomorrow should probably still read high, just like NFP. I still think we have a ways to go before interest rate hikes end. However, this doesn&amp;#x27;t make the idea of a soft landing impossible. So far, it looks like the FEDs are threading this fine line carefully and markets are holding up. Best way to take advantage of this with least stress is still credit spreads in this kangaroo market. Don&amp;#x27;t think equities go much much higher than this for now. Still at resistance and earnings are over so not much headwinds or big news barring a black swan event.</content>

      <content>Generally, I think a slightly lower than expected CPI number is mildly bullish for equities cause it implies a possible slowdown of rate hikes. However, the number is still too high. Today&amp;#x27;s movement should be faded back to pre-CPI levels, think $BTC possibly retests down to 27. 6k minimally then we watch that level. I still think Bitcoin and Gold will hold around these price levels. Good for scalps. If we get another chance at a 24-25k $BTC that level is crucial, $XAU probably holds steady here.</content>

      <content>Historically, I don&amp;#x27;t see BTC in the same vein as Gold, BTC is too volatile to be considered a safe haven asset, and it correlates very strongly with the indices. So Inflation up, Equities down, BTC down/muted, Gold up. With today&amp;#x27;s lower than expected inflation, Equities up, BTC up/muted, Gold down. As always, FED guidance is more important.

      <content>Why I still think credit spreads are good if you are aiming for a chill way to grow your portfolio. I think the rate that inflation is going down is still slow, given the geopolitical headwinds, and their lack of ability to provide stimulus anymore if the FEDs are aiming for a soft landing. It&amp;#x27;s unlikely we see significant volatile bullish momentum to the upside, If anything it&amp;#x27;s just a slow grind. Still same levels for $BTC &amp;amp; $SPY, looking at these 2 today.</content>

      <content>As you can see from my previous assessments above; we fade the FOMC day by going bearish neutral with credit spreads. Of course with CPI data today, you could continue bearish neutral and still be profitable but I employed more direct short selling for more profits as I think we stayed at this region long enough.

      <content>So where do we long? I prefer to wait for FOMC guidance and the debt ceiling on Friday to be released first along with more confluence of my indicators. I am still in my 3/6 Months $GLD Gold Bull Put spreads of course. I am not entirely sure on the rhetoric of $BTC as a safe haven asset as I mentioned but I like gold. If you scroll up, I also correctly assessed the boring range last month so I did make through my credit spreads as well, albeit not as much. Also, the $TSLA short from $200 to $148 move was my most profitable trade which I also closed above. Not 100% executed optimally, but profits are profits. We move on to the next trade.</content>

      <content>A very very key region of support would be 24. 2k - 24. 5k, I would potentially bid there if we get there. These are not exact numbers and we have to wait for the day itself but these are 2 examples of setups with a 1:2 R:R, always aiming for positive expectancy.

Switching my attention to $SPY today as we got a massive miss on the Empire State Manufacturing Index (Index: -31. 8 vs -3. 7 expected vs +10. 8 April!).

      <content>We have a BIG day today. Powell speaking 2 hours after the market opens. It really speaks to how centralised the financial system is given how dependent we are on sentiments right now. I don‚Äôt think they would want to spook the markets too much given how fragile the banking system is. Probably the same rhetoric that financial conditions are sufficiently tight, inflation is coming down, and they remain nimble. RSI on $QQQ is above 70+ now, $VIX super low, and also $DXY and $SPY/$QQQ are both trending up strongly. I think the play here is to wait for $XAU &amp;amp; $BTC to reach the support levels and place buys with SLs. You can also do a call ratio back spread on $VIX or $UVXY as insurance on the main portfolio since it is sufficiently low as well. Looking at 1943 - 1935 for $XAU24. 8k - 23. 8k for $BTC15-14 for $VIXWider range because the ATR for these counters are pretty high, but the R:R for upside is definitely there!</content>

      <content>PCE inflation, the Fed&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;preferred inflation gauge,&amp;quot; RISES to 4. 4%, above expectations of 3. 9%. This is a major setback to the Fed&amp;#x27;s fight against inflation. A few weeks ago, no one was expecting further IR hikes but as we can see and as I mentioned, inflation is still sticky. I still think eventually there will be more rate hikes and a good correction to get in on stocks so not too worried at the moment. Still DCA-ing on my gold spreads!</content>

      <content>Just want to add that this is a tech rally spurred by a few big names: AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, which is why the tech index performed so well, a lot of other names are still down. This is really bad breadth. Additionally, $QQQ is within 1% of its 61. 8% fib (golden ratio) from Nov:21 top, $405, to Oct:22 bottom, $260. Why does this matter? The 2000 &amp;amp; 2008 bear markets rallies both stalled at their respective 61. 8% fib retracements! ü§îA lot is based on the debt ceiling decision! There are still warning signs (sticky inflation, regional banking crises, consumer spending slowdown, credit card balance building, etc) despite this bullish rhetoric (AI).</content>

      <content>A writeup on the debt ceiling talks. Inflation is still high and will remain stickier if we raise the debt ceiling, however it is necessary to ensure the US functions. What I think will happenRepublicans &amp;amp; Democrats stall the decision to the last minute, eventually raising ceiling. Raising the ceiling has already been priced in so expect this to be a buy the rumour, sell the news situation. Just a quick dip then market resumes trend up slowly. On the small chance, they delay to the point ratings drop, expect a more significant drop. Recall 2011 (Image Attached) The greatest risk on US debt is not the Default, it has not happened before as they can keep shifting the goal post. The greatest risk is the debate taking too long and the credit rating go down. Eventually though, I expect subsequent FOMC rate hikes to dip the market a little, but the real damage is on small banks and mortgages - more defaults and bailouts would be the one that causes a more significant drop later on.</content>

      <content>Side Note: Not all of these are great R:R, I was just experimenting between Credit &amp;amp; Debit Spreads and trying to calculate the Greeks if the positions are worth it. I think $BTC is mid-term bullish, Equities $SPY short-term bullish, next big date is probably FOMC. I am also purchasing some US bonds to try. You might be wondering, are bonds just for boomers? I don&amp;#x27;t believe so. I think having some cash equivalent is good in this market conditions as we&amp;#x27;re not going to hyper rally anyway given the yield curve is still inverted imo. We&amp;#x27;re not trying to make money off the yields but on the face value of the bond. I believe Bond Valuations are low and we are reaching a pause in hikes soon, with easing conditions, rates pause/drop, yields drop, bond prices will spike. Given I am not putting a 6 digit sum, and I don&amp;#x27;t think everyone has 6 digits to casually throw around, I am looking into bond funds (i. e. PIMCO, SEI, VWESX). Also increasing exposure on my Chinese Equities slowly on another account! Still optimising my portfolio allocation and practising some QF.</content>

      <content>Likewise on $BTC, it is somewhat correlated to $SPY, it has a high correlation depending on the narrative. If it is a IR related news event or a M2 money supply related I think they correlate. However, if it relates to financial system breakdown there is some dissonance. If this does not make sense to you, it&amp;#x27;s okay. We bid 26. 8 - 27. 1k, next leg I believe is up. Even at absolute worst, there is support at 25k. I suggest not to be highly levered as the ATR on $BTC is huge. Both of these trades are quite speculative as we have no way of knowing when the debt ceiling will be signed. If you want a sure-er way of making money. Just sell cash covered puts for both or waiting for the supports to buy instead of trying to short.</content>

      <content>$BTC down to 26. 8k - 27. 1k as I mentioned earlier and $SPY already being pushed down on ES/US500 futures. I also made additional profits from my $SPY cash covered puts not assigning, I generally put them below supports and I further try to time them by calculating daily ATR/IV to make sure they don&amp;#x27;t get assigned unless I really want them to. I did strikes 418, 415, 411 on 30/5, 31/5 and 02/6 respectively. First one has already expired without assigning and I re-opened 411 right after that closed. These are just meant to close my short and average to a better entry/hedge the position. Will be putting all my trades on excel and doing livestreams soon. Just relocating right now!

On my options account, I do debit/credit spreads, large swing plays ONLY as I cannot close in after hours such as now, however, since I benefit from decay I am not concerned with smaller swings outside of US hours. That being said Gold has a lot of movement even in London hours, rarely in Asian hours. For my CFD account I do strict buy/sell as I am able to close at any time of the day.

      <content>Support at 1949-1951 for $XAU. Close shorts flip into longs there. I normally close before the High Volume Node and wait for guppy/technicals flip. All fluid!London session will likely form a base support for gold. With US equities continuing to drawdown, I expect gold to relief back up in the US Session. Probably a risk-on/risk-off scenario. $BTC does not play on this narrative. I think $BTC slowly decouples as a risk asset later on this year and goes up for the next leg.</content>

Okay in hindsight, the sell put 415 was quite dumb but considering all the CC puts I sold the last 3 days, I get 0. 35 credit for it.

      <content>Warning when trading news, if you do this - it is quite easy to trade if you can interpret the data fast; in terms of strength &amp;amp; subsequent move. Generally if you have access to Bloomberg terminal, you can assess news/data the second it comes out. The last prop firm and bank I worked at, I was able to take advantage of this. For retails, your next best bet would be to use Twitter/refresh forex factory. Faster data doesn&amp;#x27;t automatically mean better entry anyway; as market can wick both sides on the second news drops. You are generally 15-30s later on your own but still fast enough then most other retails imo. For instance, this debt ceiling move is very largely already priced in but I think dollar cools off here these next few days. I would not day trade this particular news.

      <content>$TSLA still running! This news has been out for a long while but I think we&amp;#x27;re in a low volume node now. Tesla has legs till 255-259 eventually. To me $NVDA is a bit out of steam. It needs to trickle down into other stocks and the economy has to have more breadth if this rally is to be sustained. Still due for a minor pullback on equities in my opinion.</content>

While we have news FTX might be re-opening, there is also no reason a lot of these ALTs are still around and will survive what will be a stricter and more regulatory environment moving forward!These positions will hedge my $BTC buys which I think alts will shift back into after this drama subsides. . . ‚úåüèºJoin me trading at Toobit:https://www. toobit. com/en-US/register/invite?invite_code=yHEHQs</content>

      <content>There will be a lot more forced selling &amp;amp; all you need to do is stay abreast of which coins are going to be delisted. Cardano, Polygon, and Solana already delisted by Robinhood (16 hours ago), along with Matic, Ada, Solana with Coinbase (24 hours ago). . . Very clear the SEC means business now. Not spreading FUD but I think most of these coins don&amp;#x27;t recover. I am only a believer in Bitcoin/Eth long-term personally for me - I don&amp;#x27;t care for L2s or Alts.</content>

      <content>A lot of news this morning I need to update but I think these are important. The SEC is also re-defining the lines of their credit rating references. They&amp;#x27;ve done this previously with inflation definitions (&amp;quot;changing calculations&amp;quot;) and recession guidelines (&amp;quot;2 consecutive quarters&amp;quot;). What does this tell me?Either they are already poised for a downgrade given their irresponsible QE and debt ceiling upgrades and are front running the impact possibly. In addition, to CPI, FOMC, and the TGA refill draining liquidity. I might be wrong, but I still stand by my stance that it is risk-off for the markets here at least for the near-term.

      <content>One thing I am watching very closely is the XRP lawsuit. I think how it is defined as a security on the context of Howe&amp;#x27;s Law may allow crypto to run-up. This lawsuit will set the precedence for regulatory actions regarding crypto, allowing for a run-up after this drama subsides. I rather be reactive than predictive - most retail are too slow to catch the run-up anyway or too fast to catch the falling knife. Once news is out, I&amp;#x27;ll decide.

      <content>Still holding on to $BNB shorts; I think one thing to note is that Binance holds 70-80% of circulating supply and they might need to dump some holdings to insure deposits. I am unsure how they operate but I am almost certain all Crypto Exchanges operate unscrupulously in some capacity, they are likely lending out your deposits in T-Bills/Collateralizing it in Stables. Floor can be deep on this so not taking profits yet, just trailing very distant stops. Can&amp;#x27;t hold this forever due to funding though. . . I&amp;#x27;ll make a bold claim and say Binance will not be allowed back into the US anymore and that absence of market liquidity coupled with their self-inflated price as they are the only MM will make it so we don&amp;#x27;t see ATH on this anymore.

      <content>The more BNB drops, the more BTC/ETH CZ sells as &amp;quot;plunge protection&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;insurance fund&amp;quot; and that includes your funds [if they&amp;#x27;re still on Binance]. I think Binance stays as a platform IF CZ has not been commingling funds - I have seen Binance function when $BNB was single digit and it&amp;#x27;s profitability as a business from the derivative market standpoint is not at all affected by US Regulatory shut-down, as for the valuation of $BNB however and other crypto, short-term dip - I will still be buying for the long-term.</content>

      <content>Inflation came out 4. 0, 0. 1 under expectations of 4. 1. Still I think core inflation with housing &amp;amp; food is much stickier. These numbers to me don&amp;#x27;t mean much. Clearly analysts knew inflation would be coming down hence the run-up recently. Doesn&amp;#x27;t detract from the fact that the breadth of this market is still very very bad. I expect it to retrace still so holding on to my bear put spreads and selling calls on my portfolio positions - Won&amp;#x27;t be buying calls here. June to September are also historically bad months for equities/crypto. A likely pause this FOMC but still cautious of hawkish guidance from the FEDs as well as quadruple witching! Should still have volatility this week!</content>

      <content>Powell speaks now, with a tinge of Volckerism. Inflation is indeed slowing and they can afford to be more data-driven but we are still far from 2% where things are. I still believe there is a technical dip coming and that dip is the one worth buying.

      <content>Fed&amp;#x27;s Powell: &amp;quot;We are watching CRE carefully. . . I do expect there will be losses in commercial real estate&amp;quot;I think conditions will not ease until 2024. This pause is just meant to aid the TGA liquidity dump and protect banks, it needs markets to run higher. The playbook for fomc meetings once again is to fade the initial news (unless unexpected) once powell speaks it reverses and then fade it again after it closes. Generally just a whipsaw and spike in volatility; which is why we long vega &amp;amp; do debit spreads or consider straddles.</content>

      <content>Once again, this is an extreme stretch, but if we ever do get a black swan event and Binance truly fails - look for the long-term support at 8-12k. Back in December we wish we bought more at those same 15. 9 - 16. 3k levels. I have traded Crypto for 7 years since my old Bitmex days, and before that OTC - You never know with Crypto, as it&amp;#x27;s pursuant to too many regulatory forces trying to shut it down (from Mt Gox, to Bitmex, to Luna, to 3AC, to FTX). It is after all, anti-government, anti-establishment, anti-FED &amp;amp; an extremely leveraged/speculative market. Yet one thing it is, is that it is scarce, and when it rallies, it rallies. Make sure you have ammo for disaster if it happens. Don&amp;#x27;t expect but always prepare for these events.</content>

      <content>A year ago, at 60k, I targeted 15-18k for buys on Bitcoin &amp;amp; shorted all the way down almost perfectly adding on each wave up. (If y&amp;#x27;all recall I was posting 5-6 Digits Live PnL quite often then)12th December 2022 I called to buy 16. 3k and after the first impulse wave I targetted 25k, then a drawdown to 20k and the move to 30k. All trades logged here. Last Month, at 30k, I said to watch for support at 23-25k, we&amp;#x27;re here now!Only thing I can say now is that we truly go to shit, it is if Binance fails, Regulatory Blanket Bans, and/or Systemic Token Failure but doesn&amp;#x27;t change my long-term view of Crypto so i&amp;#x27;ll bid still at every support cause i&amp;#x27;m laddering really slowly. I even said a year ago if we hit 8-12k it&amp;#x27;s in March - June 2023. (I think this is extremely unlikely) &amp;amp; time models are largely inaccurate (so should be taken with a pinch of salt). I think we get our rally in 2025-2027, when conditions ease, so if that&amp;#x27;s your long-term timeframe, all good. All there, unedited if you scroll up.</content>

      <content>Many countries are now pausing, while China is full-on easing monetary conditions, I think this posits a strong possibility China markets run-up. The markets yesterday called Powell&amp;#x27;s bluff, historically (90% of the time, except 1981 with Paul Volker FED Chair) after it pauses it tends to remain paused. However, countries like the UK had to backpedal on this and hike rates in subsequent meetings. Personally, I still enjoy holding my holdings in SGD, cause we have gradual modest appreciation with our $SNEER lines. However, we can&amp;#x27;t appreciate too heavily or we will be uncompetitive with our exports. Source: China cuts rates.</content>

      <content>Gave the numbers more than a month ago! I called the bottom on Gold (1935), Bitcoin (24. 8), and VIX (14). All 3!The one thing I did not expect was $VIX to be so manipulated. Historically, VIX has been used by traders to hedge portfolio positions. This is my first time in my 7 years of trading (and apparently more) that VIX has gone down with SPY going up, and vice versa. I have a theory on this that this is due to the introduction of 0DTEs, which mess up the put call parity, as well as the volatility. Hence, making this run-up on equities both overextended and so beyond the Bollingers, and other extension models. Yes, you can argue with me &amp;quot;it&amp;#x27;s AI&amp;quot;, I think this is purely manipulation where funds keep prices up while buying 0DTEs, crushing volatility while keeping up. It WILL eventually rug. However, I do not have information on what funds are doing, all I know is that when they pull the plug - it&amp;#x27;s gonna be a nasty drop.</content>

      <content>Quick assessment of markets;$BTC still conservatively bullish here. I believe we range a bit so I am cutting my levered holdings due to funding and I am holding my spot. $QQQ to me still topped out &amp;amp; overextended for this year &amp;amp; breadth is still horendous. I expect liquidity to drain from TGA and spread into smallers caps - looking at Dow Jones &amp;amp; Russell to reallocate my portfolio later on these few months. My long dated bear spreads are barely just positive already. Also why I chose to do bear spreads instead of direct puts if you saw above. This strategy alone saved my portfolio given how crazy this tech runup has been. $XAU, gold in mild bearish trend but I don&amp;#x27;t believe we break much lower, 1800-1870 is a huge demand zone and inflation is still high like it or not ‚úåüèº</content>

      <content>I still don&amp;#x27;t think there&amp;#x27;s enough accumulation just yet for the impulse wave 3 on $BTC. It might take awhile and we likely chop here a couple weeks but I still believe we retest 30k and break through it the next time round so holding spot.

      <content>I have been saying $BTC bullish, $SPY/$QQQ down, $XAU gold still neutral bearish since last few weeks. All perfect calls, timing wise almost to the dollar ü´°When you take overleveraged positions, you are leveraging not just the position, but your emotions. When you increase your margin, it also decreases your margin of error. A lot of the ability to hold trades, is not just conviction, but proper sizing &amp;amp; risk management. I try to get perfect entries as a way of lowering my pain tolerated, but I am always prepared for pain in a trade. Everything is calculated!Trades taken/Positions Update:$BTC spot from 24. 8k I am holding till 32. 5k-34k, possibly flipping bearish after 34k. Bear Call/Put Spreads on $QQQ from 360 finally turning green. One of my hardest bearish positions but time is on my favour with spreads. Gold $XAU at 1935 bought, 1982 sold. Did not short, waiting for longs at 1870-1890 region I mentioned. Probably tests the demand zone and the 200 EMA. Wait for the entries/Opportunities, don&amp;#x27;t blindly chase. Same with life &amp;amp; relationships. For previous analysis use the search bar on the counter $BTC $QQQ $SPY $XAU. I seldom trade anything else with size.</content>

      <content>While the US Debt Ratings Downgrade is concerning, other indicators are still pointing towards a strong economy. This weeks PMI and Jobs Report numbers will be indicative of that and slow down this drop in my opinion. However, we&amp;#x27;re coming into the weaker months of the year based on seasonality, I expect a short-lived downtrend the next couple of months. I believe tech ($TSLA, $NVDA) is grossly overvalued right now, but I don&amp;#x27;t want to short against irrationality. Hence, I will just be trading gold $XAU down to 1905-1920. I believe crypto market cap in general will be muted and ranging, but alts will go down more, and I can see $ETH going down to 1720-1730 support.

      <content>1850-1890 is a great point to start laddering into the $RUT (Russell 2000) for long-term investing. I believe the wider breadth might reduce your down-side risk. However, personally right now I am on a small short on equities but I am selling Cash-covered puts on $SPY for $420-425 for about $2 credit for 15th September for the long-side. Not effectively delta neutral but decay is in my favour. Credit taking however is not exceptionally great here due to Implied Volatility not being high. Rudimentarily this means we&amp;#x27;re not in an exceptionally volatile environment, i. e. there is some market indecision. Hence, premiums and a credit-taking strategy is not exceptionally favourable here. Trade on XM here for $500 Deposit Extra: XM August Promo</content>

      <content>Watch 1959 on $XAU Gold &amp;amp; 29. 1 - 29. 4k on $BTC . Probably see some slow continuation here before we drop backdown - this is just a bearish retest. I don&amp;#x27;t see any more major move to the upside in the next 1-2 months frankly. Still think that last US Credit Ratings drop was a pivotal point that we are going into some hawkish/headwind months. The fact that jolts jobs data (lowest job opening since Sept 2021) and consumer confidence just fell so much implies that the economy is not that strong, you also have to consider the lag effect.

      <content>As I mentioned, I think the US Credit Ratings Drop, followed by the Jackson Hole speech is indicative of the short-term Hawkish environment. Cooling cursory inflation data negates the need for rate hikes, but this weakening jobs data could posit a 2nd round of hikes. Bitcoin &amp;amp; Gold are highly sensitive to rising US Interest Rates, the latter more specifically, as these increase the opportunity cost of holding - why speculate on gold when you can get safe and high return from higher yields from higher rates. These are very speculative. However, I can see $XAU, gold dropping slowly to at least 1850 (Possible HTF Pennant). Similarly with $BTC, Bitcoin, a full extension drop will bring us to 23. 9 - 21. 2k (Possible HTF Swing Failure Bottom). I am cautiously bearish. With these, we also have to consider the contagion effect of the re-emerging Evergrande Crisis; accounting for 30% of Chinese GDP, a default would possibly require a Chinese Government Bailout.

      <content>Just to be clear I think dollar strengthens since inflation is hot and we are going to get more rate hikes through till the end of the year. Funds should start going risk off as they repo their portfolio and take profits from all the tech gains (Just like Jensen Huang). Currently - BTC and Equities still bearish, Bullish gold in the short term. Long run, I think everything still goes up because the inflation machine is still strong and everything is going to be propped up.</content>

      <content>I will put a very tight trailing SL for $SPY at 441. 8 once we break under 440. 8. If we break this demand zone convincingly we should get to 437/438 or even lower. However, I believe we are in a bull market still. This move is just flushing out longs/calls, it can overextend down but that dip is still for buying!</content>

      <content>Gold ($XAU) likely see resistance at 1939 - 1941. This is a shorter-term view of the previous attached Gold Chart. I see support on $SPY at 440-441 respectively. Occasionally Gold and SPY will move inversely if it is a risk on/risk off scenario, but they can also move correspondingly if its a major dollar movement since it&amp;#x27;s the underlying currency they are both pegged too.  It&amp;#x27;s important to ignore the actual FOMC hike numbers unless they&amp;#x27;re out of expectations, as usual, the guidance will be more important, and i speculate that there will still be rate hikes proposed in November. Leaning on more upside for $XAU and slightly more downside for $SPY. (Trade with me here on XM)</content>

      <content>Defence Stocks in a New World OrderIf you scroll through my past postings, you guys will realise I have been an advocate for defence stocks like LMT over the last 2 years. This is up 7% today and steadily rising since Covid. In Ray Dalio&amp;#x27;s Theories on the Changing World Theory - we often see that world powers dominance are in a cyclical nature. Hyperinflation, Dollar Milkshake Theory, Petrodollar all contribute to how the US weaponises their dollar. In short, it buys oil from the Saudi&amp;#x27;s essentially for free through incessant printing of USD. At the same time, supplying weapons to the Middle East &amp;amp; Ukraine, &amp;#x27;profiting&amp;#x27; from conflict. Even when we eventually de-dollar, or any black swan events happens, one thing is for certain, the US will not go down without a fight. When Russia invaded Ukraine, the stock jumped ~30% in 3 days. Since the start of 2022, $LMT is up ~25% as geopolitical tensions have escalated globally. Trade with me on XM</content>

      <content>To Hike or not to hike?Currently, Markets are priced for no change in rates with the probability at 95%. Once again, the guidance thereafter is more important. I believe that the FEDs cannot afford to cut rates as inflation as I have said for the whole year - is too sticky and inaccurately reported. Housing prices still remain high, and this has long term ramifications on Population Data &amp;amp; Long Run Productivity. My rhetoric remains that we have higher for longer and they will only cut if the current rates break something (i. e Banking ystem, Mortgages, etc). I believe we still see another ersatz run-up on equities. TLDR: Given No Hike. Equities rally into the new year. With the possibility of hikes later on. Cuts only if system breaks.

      <content>D1 analysis on EUR/USD.   We had a huge contraction in Q3 üìâ, following the macro bearish trend on EUR/USD.   Currently we have been seeing a bullish rally into Q4 but it is likely a retracement into equilibrium prices / premium.   We currently have 2 possible scenarios for the rest of the year.   Scenario 1: Price continues the bullish rally into equilibrium price level, mitigates the daily supply before continuing the overall bearish trend.  Possible catalysts: ECB continues to hike interest rates while the US maintains.   Scenario 2: Price consolidates around the 1. 06 region due to uncertainty in the two central banks&amp;#x27; monetary policy decisionReact if you&amp;#x27;d like to see more analysis!Trade on XM</content>

I expect this to be a big fake out and if interest rates rise high enough next year along with a debt crisis, we start seeing cracks in the real estate market/banking sector. Selling covered calls and hedging along the way up using call ratio back spreads on VIX or SQQQ accordingly because we can&amp;#x27;t predict for black swan events.

      <content>Still see upside on US equities as I believe dollar is to weaken and equities chop up towards the end of the year. I think over time the $QQQ rally will slow down and disperse over to the $SPY and $RUT2000. A sustained rally requires breadth. Hence, still in all my positions. Only selling covered calls. This equities run-up in my opinion will come at the cost of the USD strength and $DXY seeing new lows as we see other countries dump more US Debt and Treasuries. Just to consider - we have a Santa Claus rally and have an election year coming up in 2024. This is supported by the recent statements by Dr. Ed Yardeni: ‚ÄúWe remain bullish on $SPX, which we expect will consolidate for a few more days before resuming the Santa Claus rally. We are still forecasting 4600 by year-end. A solid break above 4550 gap fill could signal a good start for stocks in 2024. ‚ÄùTrade with me on XM</content>

Watch NVIDIA&amp;#x27;s earnings especially closely tomorrow.

      <content>DXY Daily Chart Pre-FOMC DXY bearish since Q4 and is currently at a D1 demand zone that coincides with the equilibrium level between Q3&amp;#x27;s range.   If the demand zone fails to hold price I expect a continuation of the bearish trend into discount levels at the . 618 - . 782 region, with the 102. 00 psychological level in sights.   The bearish dollar this quarter has been fueled by anticipation of rate cuts in the near future as early as Q1 &amp;#x27;24.   In contrast, XAU/USD is up 10% in the same period. XXX/USD pairs should see a similar bullish rally. Trade with me on XM</content>

      <content>End of week EUR/USDPrice this week pretty much just created a range, with 1. 0965 being the high of the week and 1. 0852 being the low of the week. The bullish trend continues, with the D1 supply and 1. 1000 level in sights. The data from Germany showed that the headline German IFO Business Climate Index improved to 87. 3 in November from 86. 9 in October. The Current Assessment Index edged higher to 89. 4 from 89. 2, while the Expectations Index rose to 85. 2 from 84. 8. Although these figures came in slightly below analysts&amp;#x27; estimates, they had virtually no impact on the Euro&amp;#x27;s valuation. There are still lingering fears of a recession in the Euro zone but the bullish trend continues  for now. Trade with me on XM</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR AnalysisAs expected, the bullish rally continued into the daily supply, and the 1. 1000 level was met. We are currently trading in the daily supply zone and we can only look for shorts once price shows bearish confirmations. Other than that longs are still in play, but I will only consider discount regions on the lower timeframes. On the fundamental side of things, the Fed&amp;#x27;s less hawkish stance continues to support EUR/USD. Fed Governor Christopher Waller mentioned that they may not maintain the high interest rates. Additionally, the decline in US Treasury yields cited as an additional weakening factor for USD. For EU, Spain and Germany are expected to report a slowing in the annual inflation rate.

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR end-of-week analysisAs expected in our scenarios, price has continued to push lower after the daily supply mitigation, and has taken out one of the lows at 1. 0852. There are 2 scenarios that we could see in the coming week. 1st scenario: Price continues bearish, taking out the second key low at 1. 0825 and fills the imbalance on the 4HR chart. 2nd: scenario: Price retraces back into premium levels to fill the fair value gap above, before continuing the bearish pressure to the 4HR imbalance/demand zone below. On the fundamental side of things, easing inflation numbers fueled speculation that central banks will refrain from hiking rates further. The focus shifts to US NFP data next week. For the EU, the Euro weakened amid rumors suggesting the pause in Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) reinvestments leading to the end of the year due to low liquidity. Financial markets are pricing in a first ECB rate cut in April. Trade on XM</content>

Even though its an election year I still headwinds and the possibility of blackswan events coming into 2024. Times are still shifty. Only important dates to note are unemployment on 7th/8th December as well as CPI 13/14th December. If I were trying to be exact, I think it&amp;#x27;s still too early to flip bearish for crypto. Just logical for me to take profits here!</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR analysisThe forecasted scenario played out, with price mitigating the 4HR imbalance. With NFP coming up, there are 2 possible scenarios for price. The first scenario, price continues the bearish trend into the 4HR demand. If this happens I will wait for lower time frame confirmations before taking longs. The second scenario, price retraces up into the 1HR supply zone which coincides with the higher timeframe equilibrium levels. From there we could look to take high probability shorts. to target the 4HR demand zone. Trade on XM</content>

Lots of late longs piling here and increased OI. I am increasingly cautious given last week&amp;#x27;s rejection on $XAU. I held long enough so sticking with my opinion to close here. Waiting for the FOMC guidance to make a decision. I think we get a muted santa claus rally since everything has already been priced in and rallied already. Still see USD tanking in 2024 due to countries dumping treasuries and easing FED conditions.</content>

      <content>Weekly Trading Recap:$XAU is breaking down after NFP, I am probably going to flip long at the 0. 5 retracement below 1980. Unemployment rate is lower than expected at 3. 7. Generally, we want unemployment to rise to cool off inflation. Equity markets reacted positively to this news and I am closing off my $SPY longs VERY soon, we are getting to 460 now. Selling very tight calls, if I get assigned I will just close and buy back cheaper after CPI/FOMC next week!Not selling anymore of my $BTC. I generally only trade these 3 counters the most $SPY, $XAU, $BTC just for convenience and familiarity. I still dabble in some currencies and alts.</content>

I still expect price to continue bearish into the 4HR demand at 1. 0700. After the 4HR demand mitigation we have to wait for the release of the interest rates. Personally I feel that both the Fed and ECB will maintain their interest rates so it will be up to CPI/PPI data to be the catalyst for the rest of the week&amp;#x27;s movement. Trade on XM</content>

      <content>Waiting for the pull-back to D for $SPY approximately at 450-460. Starting 1st layer of re-entry at under 460. Should not be that deep of a retracement given fibo/elliot wave models. I do believe we get a melt-up if the FEDs follow through with their rate cuts. However, with regional banks starting to close again ($NYCB) along with BTFP ending in March, I expect the delays in cuts from Powell&amp;#x27;s more hawkish stance in yesterday&amp;#x27;s FOMC to pull this market back into consolidation; as I mentioned inflation is not that easily beaten and he is not willing to pivot so early. If we recall from the 1970s-1980s, Volcker did face a 2nd rise in inflation. Election year is a non-factor.</content>

Yesterday&amp;#x27;s news gave us a huge 4HR imbalance to fill next week. I expect 2 scenarios early on for next week. First scenario is that price retraces up to fill the 4HR imbalance at around 1. 085, before continuing the overall bearish trend. The second scenario is that price continues to be bearish and closes below the 4HR demand without mitigating the 4HR imbalance.

      <content>In China Markets; Still heavy in $BABA $KWEB $CWEB $HSI $PDD. I see more upside with China after Xi&amp;#x27;s announcement now. I have covered calls as I mentioned to hedge. Those following my Twitter would know I have been loading up! $NIO also cheap here but high risk. US Market is now pricing in 4 rate cuts instead of 6. As I mentioned previously, I expected delays in easing conditions and a second rise in sticky inflations. This will be a real stress test for regional banks $KRE and geopolitical risks will affect defence stocks $LMT. Re-bought my Crypto early and just holding. Think we get bull run for both gold and crypto in 2025 when dollar collapses when and if they have to bailout banks. All subject to change.</content>

      <content>This is still in play given the delay in rate cuts and the correlation with US equities might mean it drops when $SPY, AI bubble retraces. I have no idea when though. . . Also I am not trading for a living anymore. Just my 2 cents ‚úåüèº</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR Analysisprice is currently retracing to the upside since last week. We had a 4HR imbalance from NFP that has yet to be filled. As of now the higher timeframe bias is still bearish. 2 scenarios for me. First is that price retraces into the 4HR imbalance, gives lower timeframe confirmations to the downside and we take shorts. Second scenario is that price continues to push lower and closes below the 1. 072 region. If that happens, we can continue to take shorts. My bias will be bullish if price closes above the 4HR imbalance. Trade on XM</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR analysisPrice is still bearish on the higher timeframes. We have a 4HR supply caused from Tuesday&amp;#x27;s US CPI data coming in better than expected. Currently we are in a bullish retracement phase into premium prices. The most likely scenario is price to mitigate the 4HR supply, where we can look for potential shorts to continue the bearish trend. My bias will only be bullish if price closes above the 4HR supply zone. On the lower timeframes I would look for longs to the 4HR supply in premium prices. Trade on XM</content>

      <content>I am beginning to realise we are not going to get a wave down on $SPY for D. However, if we run straight to E at 525-535, I would honestly be extremely concerned because this smells like manipulation, driven by derivatives, 0DTEs &amp;amp; not a healthy stock market upward movement. It would very likely be a blowoff top with $NVDA in this case likely being 1200-1400 at maximum. Without a pull-back this is actually likely going to be a spectacular liquidation cascade crash downwards after. This would also mean the dollar devalues hard &amp;amp; bonds are dumped. I got stopped out of my US Equities $SPY short from 502 at small profit &amp;amp; still in my Crypto $BTC short collecting funding with a SL at BE as well now, same targets.</content>

      <content>Think we potentially get a sweep to 496 and then a final blow off rally at 425 on $SPY before a major correction. But the risk:reward on upside is not great on tech at the moment. Looking at bear credit spreads potentially on $NVDA later as we have reached our 2. 618 extension now. Very risky play but I will limit risks with options. Yesterday&amp;#x27;s FED speech shows a lot of mispricing in the markets:1. S&amp;amp;P 500 is trading like are in a new bull market carried by tech / Regional bank stocks are crashing like the crisis never ended. 2. Bonds are rising and dollar is dropping like the Fed is cutting interest rates. / Inflation data is rising like rate cuts are cancelled. 3. Bitcoin¬†is rising like there&amp;#x27;s no recession coming / Gold is rising like a recession is on the way.</content>

      <content>I am looking at 1. 2k at the top-end target for $NVDA; that should bring the final $SPY target at 525-529 for the full wave I drew since June 2023. The longer it doesn&amp;#x27;t correct, the more convinced I am we get a strong pullback there. For the time being, rally is strong so I am selling cash-secured puts and holding stocks but rebalancing and selling covered calls. As per Powell&amp;#x27;s Speech, rates are definitively going to be high for longer but with backdoor easing through the reverse repo market &amp;amp; tga.</content>

      <content>$DXY dropped almost half a percent just today alone. That&amp;#x27;s huge for currency. If you want to reposition your portfolio into a more stable bet I actually think gold has plenty of upside towards 3k. We have finally broken through the range and trending strongly above the 200 MA. China stocks are also still undervalued but in a bear tightening channel/wedge. The worse thing you can do imo is hold cash given rising inflation and a federal reserve that is more concerned for the elections and buying votes.</content>

      <content>Daylight Savings eastern time will revert back to NY open at 9:30pm Singapore GMT+8 time. Powell&amp;#x27;s closing remarks which I must highlight is that he sees more banks failing and rate cuts at the end of the year. I am sure policy makers and banking institutions are pressuring him to lower rates at the cost of a devaluing USD. I am almost certain we get fresh lows on the dollar and 5200 on $ES $SPY for our final wave which means we get a $1000+ $NVDA. My gut says we pivot reversal there. I have been correct on a lot of the larger moves over the years if you scroll through the pinned messages.</content>

      <content>Sharing some of my notes I wrote yesterday afternoon on the difference between a bear debit and credit spread on $NVDA. Not refined so might be hard to understand. Delta negative and long vega would imply doing direct puts/debit spread would be more cost efficient than a synthetic short/credit spread with better risk:reward on such a momentum based stock.

      <content>I still see China as undervalued and US as overvalued. Just a possibility is that we get a diverging wedge into a final rally into the end of the year before a major market crash in 2025 after the election year. I think it&amp;#x27;s entirely a possibility that we get a 2nd run of inflation given this equities rally and the persistent CPI as seen by today. February CPI inflation rate RISES to 3. 2%, above expectations of 3. 1%. Core CPI inflation fell to 3. 8%, ABOVE expectations of 3. 7%. This is the 35th consecutive month with inflation above 3% and second straight increase. A Fed pivot is becoming less likely. Once again, I do not recommend trading like me as I am a degenerate and I am just giving my 2 cents.</content>

      <content>Might be crazy but I can see us trending down to 511. 23-512. 11 to fill the gap on $SPY very soon. This PPI is the hottest since June 2022. Generally for the last 2 times at least - CPI causes a run-up and then it fades into a dump on PPI. We normally see bullishness on Fridays which tend to be low volatility, that&amp;#x27;s why we call it VIX crush friday. However, this Friday is slightly special because we have Triple-witching and OPEX tomorrow, coming into it with low volatility. Hence, I think Volatility/Vega spike into it and that tends to be to the downside. $BTC being a risk-on asset should also follow and our dollar strength gets a relief rally up. Long-term trend still up as long as we maintain the levels.</content>

      <content>I like $TSLA at 135-145 for some cash secured puts soon. I may or may not buy them as I have too many running positions and I don&amp;#x27;t want to overcomplicate my trading process. EV comes with a lot of competitors in the space, but I think few will make it in the long-term after some acquisition (i. e. NIOs interchangeable batteries). It just got downgraded along with $NIO. But we saw $NIO run-up from 4. 80 to 6. 20 a few days back. $TSLA will do a dead cat bounce soon for late shorters.</content>

      <content>Threat of war implies you can take a look at rotation into defence stocks $LMT $BA or even a store of value in $GLD $SLV $XAU. Boeing is pretty beaten down. Just a few to place in your watchlist. I actually like Gold given every country is stocking up reserves. I am not exactly sure if the 67. 8-68. 2k $BTC support holds long-term honestly, but it&amp;#x27;s worth a bid for a trade. I think the real huge high volume node support is 45-48k but I am not sure if we get there. Bitcoin is NOT a store of value, it is simply too volatile and should be seen as a risk-on asset like equities; it is also heavily leveraged with the recent ETF inflows and $MSTR re-financing as well.</content>

With stocks, equities, and crypto you have to be cautious with stop loss hunts such as this move up right now. However, fx lines for dollar strength are cleanly rising. I still believe risk-on trend is down temporarily for the next few weeks as the dollar is strengthening. As I said, might need this whole month after FOMC to find a bottom based on Time arcs &amp;amp; ATR indicators. If we get those $BTC levels I am bidding all-in again.</content>

      <content>Trying to be patient with the setups. Sometimes I close earlier out of principle. Such as closing the $BTC Bitcoin short at 68. 3 and then the flip long from 66. 1k earlier at 68. 3k, even though I expect it to wick to 69-70k. This applies the same for my $SPY short, I closed at 509. 85 from 518 instead of waiting for 507/508 even though my support levels are there. Currently in $SPY long from 508. 5 targeting 511. 9. While the idea would be to maximise profits, I believe in taking profits at a higher probabilistic area and ladder in the flip slightly more extended.</content>

      <content>Clean so far! Calm ‚úåüèº On a roll!Awake at the most ungodly hours with little sleep. Choosing to lower leverage and take a bigger move now to 50k potentially. Once again, I know it may sound absurd.  That&amp;#x27;s what people said the first time I targeted 18k from 69k in 2022 when I targeted 69k from 22k. (Check pinned messages. ) However, I have done this many times before. We trade probabilities not possibilities.</content>

      <content>There will probably be a bounce at 61k, but I believe 46-49k will be the larger point of control/high volume node. Whether you choose to TP early or not and re-short depends on leverage. Like I said earlier, I want to hold this down. Can I close my shorts at support and reshort? Yes. Is it worth my time? No.</content>

      <content>People always tell me $BTC Bitcoin is  a store of value - it&amp;#x27;s not. No store of value would have this kind of volatility. I have ran through large datasets on bloomberg terminal before. It&amp;#x27;s a risk asset for now plain and simple. It can change over time with halvenings and less supply would likely cause less volatility over time. By then, your chance to make life-changing money would be gone, we ride the waves of speculation and volatility till I think 2030s.</content>

      <content>Very likely we get the move to 511. 9 on $SPY at least, ES &amp;amp; US500 are moving upwards today. However, this move is still in the onset of a relief rally on the $DXY. I think this retracement up is also for shorting. Similar to the move we got with $BTC to 70k previously. 300 shares long from 508. 5 to 512 should be about 1k USD profits. Might look to divest into $XAU next. I see opportunity there when dollars devalues back down.</content>

      <content>Got our 512 on $SPY which went a bit overextended. High Volatility events in the coming days leads me to believe we chop back down. We have $NVDA GTC Conference at San Jose and FOMC starting today/tomorrow onwards. I don&amp;#x27;t want to trade $NVDA as the underlying is too expensive without a split and its too high in IV. Cash covered puts on $TSLA I mentioned previously at the 150 strike have also started printing!</content>

Same time 2 years ago I shorted $AXS from $157 to $8 which made me one of my biggest lifetime profit trades. Just be cautious with these no value memecoins. They are all largely orchestrated pump and dumps in my opinion. Just have to watch out for volume and funding when trading futures.

I believe the first move should be faded but this will be a volatile session. Tomorrow is one of the most important FOMC meeting of your life. Why?This FOMC comes with projections, minutes, and guidance. It&amp;#x27;s also a turning point - as 3 months ago, 90% concensus were expecting cuts in March. What will determine if the Fed&amp;#x27;s decision is positive or negative for cruptostocks/bonds? Simply. . . 1) How many rate cuts do the dots show for 2024?2) Whether the Fed hints at a rate cut in forward guidance?</content>

      <content>FOMC in 15 Minutes; Expecting a higher for longer hawkish guidance with no rate cuts and a lower projection of cuts expected. They&amp;#x27;ll say 2 but we might get 1 only at the late end of the year. Bullish momentum still strong though! Only expecting a temporal pullback on risk assets till start of next month, I have stated this prior. Rather than short overvaluation or equities.

      <content>FED Press Conference Post Mortem; Still on track for rate cuts in June. Powell made sure to qualify the Fed&amp;#x27;s commitment to bringing inflation back down to 2% by repeating that the target would be achieved &amp;quot;over time. &amp;quot;  However, he never clarified how much time.

      <content>I agree with the first slide&amp;#x27;s opinion that Powell caved last night to Election year demands. While the rates did not change, the dot plot stayed at 3 and the balance sheet was increased. This is extremely foolish with the Feds assumption that these risk assets inflating will not have a wealth effect that pushes inflation higher. Hence, why I decided to flip on my own accord last night as well. Still bought back cheaper than I sold. The second slide is what can happen if you marry yourself to a trade.</content>

      <content>UOB One Slashes Interest RatesWhy are we getting rate cuts? Is this bullish for the markets?1. UOB One slashing interest rates signals to me that rate cuts are all but priced in. In Singapore, we generally try to have our SIBOR rates and S$NEER line peg to the US FEDs Decisions. 2. Election year normally comes with debt forgiveness and fiscal spending to ‚Äúbuy votes‚Äù3. With US debt growing at 33 Trillion and a 5. 5% effective FEDs funds rate, the US Government paying 1. 6 Trillion in Interest Payments is simply unsustainable for their sheet. 4. If we go by the historical trends of yield curve inversions - with our current yield curve steepening. Rate cuts generally coincides with markets crashes. Hence, why I postulate we still get a correction into June when prospective rate cuts are to happen. FEDs are of course still in Catch 22 situation, but they simply HAVE to cut despite not nearly being anywhere near the 2% inflation target- we either move the goalpost, or at the cost of worsening inflation for the consumer/middle class. My nihilism inclines me to believe it‚Äôs the latter. Source: UOB One Slashes Interest Rates</content>

      <content>Same chart as per previous reply. I think the potential for a correction is still there. I will be a buyer at 55k for sure on $BTC. This &amp;quot;new ATH&amp;quot; seems like a great rhetoric to trap some longs and flush them. Trying to be patient &amp;amp; low leveraged! However, long term this year we still go up imo. Same as for AI $NVDA. Not touching $SMCI as they have too little float and outstanding shares - implying they all need to stock split soon.</content>

      <content>Let&amp;#x27;s talk March PMI - What is the Purchasing Manager Index?The Purchasing Managers&amp;#x27; Index (PMI) is¬†an index of the prevailing direction of economic trends in the manufacturing and service sectors. It consists of a diffusion index that summarises whether market conditions are expanding, staying the same, or contracting as viewed by purchasing managers. Above 50. 0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction. The ISM Services PMI in the US fell to 51. 4 in March 2024 from 52. 6 in February and below forecasts of 52. 7. With actual lesser than forecast - This generally implies a weak dollar. Preceding Powell‚Äôs speech tomorrow. This can signal a short-term rally this week in US equities, dollar-denominated risk-on assets (i. e. Bitcoin)On the contrary the China PMI came out to be 52. 7 as opposed to 52. 5 prior and as forecasted. There is some seasonality here in March. We know why this happens - a quirk of the Chinese calendar. China shuts down in late January or early February for an entire week (Spring Festival). It starts back up again and by March it looks like a boom even when it isn&amp;#x27;t. Source: Purchasing Manager&amp;#x27;s Index below Forecast</content>

      <content>Powell speaks in 15 minutes!PMI data just out is indicative of dollar weakness and a risk-on relief rally. Will most likely be a nothing burger. I will likely be closing positions on $BTC longs and scaling shorts for US Equities. Shorting a bull-market is incredibly dangerous but I am generally fast in and out. I believe the month is still bearish or flat coming into June FOMC. Fed Chair Powell is likely to hammer home the message that rate-cuts are coming but not just yet in a keynote address at Stanford University this afternoon. His remarks follow an endless parade of his peers also jawboning market expectations down (successfully) to the point where the market is now more hawkish than The Fed&amp;#x27;s latest dots.</content>

      <content>How do you trade both sides?I have already been leaning bearish this entire month but that did not mean I did not take longs. I did take longs from 508. 5 on $SPY and 59k on $BTC after shorts from 520 and 75k respectively. However, I did close those too early at 513 and 66. 6k respecitvely. I did even say I expected them to go higher if you recall but I chose instead to close them at my first TPs instead of waiting for full extension as that&amp;#x27;s a lower probability/expectancy play. However, I ONLY short on the full extension of the move and not where I close my longs giving me more margin of error. I am also cautious of a liquidity event possibility on Crypto and spoke about this on my LIVE a few days back!</content>

Fed floats narrative of No Rate CutsWhen everyone was postulating rate cuts. I was one of the crazies who thought we might not get any/or only 1 cut. I could see the bond market diverging from the dot plot. Yesterday, we had the first narrative of no rate cuts being floated around, causing the fastest 30 minutes marking the close with the $NQ $QQQ dropping over 1. 5% in the last 30 minutes!Source: No Rate Cuts Floated</content>

With halving in the next 2 days I believe to be a non-factor &amp;amp; a sell the news event. Still targeting 55k on $BTC eventually but I prefer to short stupid altcoins as opposed to Bitcoin. This retracement has been stubborn across the board with my $NVDA shorts also still not reaching my target. I am still expecting a small quick dip but the longer we stay here, the more I worried I am this is an extended move down.

      <content>Learning Points: Today&amp;#x27;s scenario of Negative GammaWe have a scenario of Negative gamma today. Short Options have negative gamma (i. e. Sell Call/Sell Put). As we are in NEGATIVE gamma, puts get paid. Once you know where the daily puts are, you know the floor. Don‚Äôt long in a negative gamma environment. Negative gamma (in the S&amp;amp;P 500) basically is a market phenomena where we see increased volatility because options market makers need to sell S&amp;amp;P futures as the market goes lower and buy them as the market goes higher. When futures are priced different from spot that&amp;#x27;s where we get Contango/Backwardation and Funding/Swaps/Etc aims to correct this. Gamma squeeze is a different phenomena. A gamma squeeze is when we have a confluence of:1) short-dated OTM long calls being bought by traders2) option volume (notional) is a substantial component of the underlying volume, e. g. , the ratio of option volume to notional underlying volume is significant and not close to 0.</content>

So the falling Yen isn&amp;#x27;t about any of that. Instead, it&amp;#x27;s about Japan&amp;#x27;s huge debt load, which forces BoJ to keep rates low even as they rise everywhere else.

      <content>I&amp;#x27;ll invalidate if we break structure. I entered pre-emptively before the swing failure top formed. R:R is there and I don&amp;#x27;t mind holding shorts since I get paid in funding. I am not heavily sized in this one. Just 3k but if we retrace 50% I make 1. 5k. $BTC could still do a triple top to 75k - I am prepared for that.</content>

      <content>GM, Let&amp;#x27;s talk Trading PsychologyI have had this public trade log for 3 years already &amp;amp; been in this space for 10 years now. There&amp;#x27;s 2 approaches to trading; (1) run it up turbo, risk crashing &amp;amp; burning(2) slow, compounded gainsBoth works. I want to believe I am good enough to do the former. Yes, I can grow a 3 digit account to 7 relatively fast with risk, but it&amp;#x27;s entirely different to turn a 7 digit account to 8 even alone. Whenever I do the former (1) and take high leverage/size/margin, I do make huge profits, but then at the same time, I stop working out, live like a hobo &amp;amp; I burn out for 2-3 months after that - just due to general health/mental toll/quality of life issues. There was also an instance I had dry eyes and was in the hospital just from staring at the screen too much. Over the years, I have been awake at ungodly hours with my trading view alerts and scripts trying to snipe perfect entries. Yet perhaps the superior strategy I realised would be (2) and just to trade on a longer outlook, lower size, more sleep, better health/longevity and less stress. Why don&amp;#x27;t I trade more counters? I believe anything can be traded, I&amp;#x27;ve tried forex, crypto, nfts, stocks, commodities across almost every kind of derivatives (forward, swaps, cfds, options, futures) - I am simply just used to $BTC, $XAU, $SPY/$ES, $QQQ/$NQ as my mainstays. I have to recalculate my lot sizing, r:r, volatility and greeks whenever I touch new counters. Not messing with a system that works.</content>

      <content>Booked shorts, flipped long. Market was heavy for a while. There were signs. Most recently the reaction to HK ETF launch headline, which we not only didn&amp;#x27;t pump but went down on. And the positive inflows with price down days. The Iranian strike served as a catalyst, people were looking for a reason to sell. This is also supported by Dalio&amp;#x27;s theory and principles on &amp;quot;Why Nations succeed and fail. &amp;quot; You can see these with the rise in commodities, defence stocks and precious metals lately, and the steep sell off in risk-on assets in tech, crypto, EVs and equities.

      <content>How much blood? ü©∏$2B+ Wiped from the open interest. Funding rates went temporarily negative close to the 60k local bottom. That&amp;#x27;s one hell of a week-end flush. Haven&amp;#x27;t seen one as bad as this the entire bull market. When funding goes negative and you see mass liquidations at this speed, generally we get a decent relief rally? Why? Funding in Futures is rudimentarily speaking like Rho in Options and Overnight/Swap Fees in CFDs; it&amp;#x27;s the cost of borrowing. With prevailing US interest rates at 5. 5%, negative funding implies you get paid to open longs/you get paid to buy. Rare scenario, but we saw this before in March 2020 as well. I&amp;#x27;ve seen larger crypto flushes ofc but this one is the fastest in recent memory.</content>

      <content>Equities Futures look to be opening green üëÄüòÇ This is why I closed off my $NVDA shorts as well on Friday. I can see relief if no nukes. I do not like holding risk over the weekend on equities these days, there&amp;#x27;s too much I cannot control. Weekend Wall Street is generally illiquid and manipulative. When playing with derivatives, it&amp;#x27;s highly important to be perceptive to Options hours, Forex Sessions, Futures carry. Pros of a Futures perpetual market like Bitcoin is I can actively manage positions. Cons is I literally have the worst circadian rhythm known to man.</content>

      <content>Buttcoin rallies off fading TensionsVery strong rally of the lows. Can&amp;#x27;t really control where this goes as I actually think it&amp;#x27;s not based on technicals for once, and just how the Israel/Global turmoil situation develops. Seeing a lot of false alarms of retaliation the last couple hours. Not selling into the FUD. 66. 4-66. 8k looks like the next stop for $BTC ü§ùüèº Not too worried as I had many good trades in a row before this so I have a lot of profits to buffer, notwithstanding my long entry is pretty good at 62. 6k. Holding above 64. 7k here is crucial for continuation. Cautiously bullish - I have tightened stops.</content>

As usual, I shall be the voice of reason and stay contrarian being bear at the top and bullish on this drop. $BTC and crypto is leading the risk-on rebound, we got our final wick below 60k.

      <content>Market Recap:Short-term outlook (1 Week): Stocks &amp;amp; Crypto to Bounce, Gold &amp;amp; Dollar to weaken. Mid-term outlook (1 Month): Equities continue down to final targets before resume. Long-term outlook (1 Year): Gold &amp;amp; Silver at 3k eventually; Final blow off bull run of risk-assets into 2025 to close off the election year; maybe we get a financial collapse of the monetary system somewhere along the way - will consider Hedges with Vix. This bull-run thesis changes if we break certain levels but if 450 $SPY holds and 40-50k $BTC holds I don‚Äôt see why we don‚Äôt continue upwards with our money printers!Chat Update:Also, i‚Äôll do be doing exclusive coaching calls June onwards and scaling off lesser daily updates on this chat. Been already doing it for 3-4 years for free now. I personally do not day-trade anymore, neither do I want to coach it as it will mess with my psych√© and longer term opinions. Partly another reason why I was hesitant about doing courses is that I do not want to change/teach a different style of trading as opposed to mine which is working for me. I believe if I am as good a trader as I believe I can be then I should be able to compound an actually sizeably large portfolio over the next few years and I will not get there selling signals as a get rich quick scheme. My teachings will not be short-term signals based.</content>

      <content>This is a close-up of the wedge I drew in March. I have stated March/April to be Bearish. We reach full drop potentially to 455-465 on $SPY in June based on Time arcs. Elliot Waves ABCDE should look like this. I can see $NVDA at 600s at the end of this easily. The larger wedge see us continuing upwards after that.

      <content>R:R actually not great for longs cause we generally do stairs up and elevator down for risk assets - which implies that there also not much &amp;quot;meat&amp;quot; from A to B as your wave 1 is normally your smallest wave as compared to the impulse wave C, also need to validate Elliot Waves with stochastics. Look how the sell the news event happened with the halving and how well-timed this turmoil is. . . Suspiciously feels orchestrated which is why I mentioned we would have a liquidity event.

Currently looking at a 1HR FVG here to take shorts on after price sweeps the previous week&amp;#x27;s high. if the 1HR FVG is invalidated we can look for longs to target the 4HR imbalance above higher in premium.

      <content>Already green on my $SPY and $NVDA longs. Good closes on my short, as I mentioned I have fully closed. Ate the majority of the meat with my $SPY short from 523 to 497 as well as $NVDA from 910. I think there&amp;#x27;s a relief rally here at least. Holding positions and reassessing on Thursday, nothing new.</content>

      <content>Markets are pricing in rate hikes now after months of running up on sentiments of rate cuts. I believe we still get our cuts after a liquidity credit event brings us down to our final buy point with $SPY at 450-470 and $BTC at 45-55k. For now, we relief up with a risk-on scenario with gold falling. Still in my risk asset longs! There are of course many options to make money here. I could have shorted gold or I could have long equities. I did both. Will be selling cash secured puts on $GLD soon to reassign the gold I sold at the top. This is a neutral bearish strategy as we have dropped a fair amount today. ECB is probably going to cut rates first in June, implying a weakening euro against a strong dollar. Thus, EURUSD bearish in the mid term.</content>

      <content>Told you guys Gold would reject off the kill zone at 2400! This was a good $XAU short as in terms of percentage movement, it was more than an equivalently sized $SPY long. More bang for your buck in terms of higher volatility when gold is not conventionally volatile. $XAU should find support at 2260-2292 where $SPY would correspondingly be at 505-507 where I will exit longs. I am going to sell cash secured puts with a 5-10 days expiration for gold based on how much I think it could move during this period (We optimise by calculating delta/gamma for $GLD).</content>

      <content>China and US futures are printing in Asian hours. As I said, still in longs. Thursday unemployment claims &amp;amp; FOMC next week I will have to assess flow. If my speculating is correct this S&amp;amp;P 500 rally has ~75 pts of upside towards 515 on $SPY before stalling and resuming the corrective decline that started at the beginning of the month. I did say this relief will be hard and strong; it truly has been fast. We might push to 512. 5-515 &amp;amp; that will be my final extended target.</content>

      <content>To be clear: I am confident in some of my long-term holdings $BABA $BYD but I will dump $NVDA $TSLA quickly for scalps as the former is still overvalued and the latter still has headwinds interms of CapEx and Sales. To me I did short and long gold perfectly at 2400 and 2290 as shared as well, and I still see 3000 eventually on $XAU after a further sweep down which will be in line with the equities run-up since they are generally inverse.

      <content>US relief rally looks to be stalling with price trading near 5100 yesterday, and starting to trade back below 5000 this morning. The best relief rallies convince participants the pullback is over. Staying ‚Äòstuck‚Äô in this 5000-5150 range for another week would help that cause. Decline targets remain 4800, and the 4500-4600 range under a stronger corrective move. I am not ruling out a final $SPY move to 511-515 if you read my twitter. I think this takes 1-2 weeks to trap some longs. Gold can then possibly recontinue the run to 3000s on a risk-off scenario. China might pull back a little if there&amp;#x27;s a liquidity/major geopolitical crisis so I would watch the inverse HnS trendline.</content>

      <content>Wow üòÆ‚Äçüí® I made 840. 52% now! All by doing nothing but shifting the leverage up, at no risk to the FURUs notional running size. Common grift. Ask your FURU for their PnL statements, most are generally larpers. Personally for myself, I only use 1-1. 5x leverage (in terms of Margin used). More leverage means you need to be more precise, and that also lowers your margin of error possibility. Greater leverage while can mean greater profits and losses, can also mess with your trade systems - as you are not only risking more, but also leveraging your emotions. No great trader with proper size uses heavy leverage.</content>

      <content>$SPY might give us 511-515. However, I have fully exited my longs at 507 as I mentioned. Will slowly be laddering in shorts. However I still believe trend to be down by May/June. 1 Bank Closure is not going to cause the collapse immediately. Unlike other Finance Gurus (not that I consider myself one), I think I have been very consistent and transparent with my trade setups and direction. I have not been flipping back and forth because of inconsequential intraday market movements. I do not daytrade as I said. Training myself to hold positions which can only be done with little to minimal leverage for sanity of mind.</content>

      <content>One of the slowest retracements - tells me I don&amp;#x27;t think it&amp;#x27;s going to go that deep. The largest economy US is possibly tightening but the 2nd &amp;amp; 3rd largest economy in China &amp;amp; Japan are moving into easing conditions. Hence, $BTC as a global asset is torn on where to go. Max pain - 48-54k. As of now, if those levels hold, I think the devaluing Yen &amp;amp; Yuan will push prices to ATH eventually - Asian buyers will save the crypto market.</content>

      <content>Yen Drops Massively despite Tightening RatesThe yen‚Äôs plunge to 34-year lows (falling 11 per cent against the US dollar so far this year) has come despite a historic exit from negative rates last month as traders bet Japanese rates will remain low for some time. The Estimated Yen carry trade* in stocks and bonds is ~$4. 5 trillion. The carry trade occurs when one *Borrows in a currency with low rates (Yen) and investing proceeds in a higher-yielding currency (USD). Japan is also the second largest holder of US Debt behind China. It is a big risk if it unwinds. The more the Yen falls the higher probability that the Bank of Japan will rise rates or maybe even the US Fed will cut if risks goes global. In that case carry trade becomes less profitable and may trigger capital outflow from US bonds and stocks. Source: Yen all-time Low</content>

      <content>Very rare that we get negative funding in $BTC, should have some tiny relief here - negative funding and huge long liquidations would be my queue to flip long. presently only the former of those criterias are met. Negative funding implies you are being paid to long and borrow money; just means there are too many market participants on the short-side of the market in derivatives. Derivative flows often dictate the markets more than spot as there&amp;#x27;s just more volume/liquid in those market.</content>

      <content>How-to Stink BidHow I do this is that I ladder across High Volume Nodes and different demand zones. If it goes down to my max extension point, I will likely be up to 1. 5-2. 5x Cross Leveraged; hence, price would need another 33-50% drop to liquidate me. To prevent this, I either ladder across a wider region or pre-place an SL with my orders. I use pretty rudimentary math and IV to see how far it can go but over the years, this system has worked for me in getting very good entries. Crypto works brilliant for this as there are so many leveraged retail players buying into higher extrinsic value. Fair Warning: You should also research the depth, orderbooks &amp;amp; market markets of your respective exchanges as back in March 2020, some exchanges were actually illiquid and books were so thin everyone was essentially liquidated. I can name many examples just of experience.</content>

      <content>Bearish economic data today as well as risk-off into FOMC. Feels like a nothing burger though so far though!Market is probably starting to price in a potentially hawkish rhetoric by Powell given the last 3 months of persistent inflation data. I think the devaluing Yen &amp;amp; Yuan is also of concern to the US Fed as they are the largest 2 holder of US debt and might dump treasuries to perk their own currencies, while buying more gold for reserves. If we do continue higher for longer, I think more banks will crack as well.</content>

      <content>There&amp;#x27;s a rudimentary math behind what I do. Why I don&amp;#x27;t add more shorts, and why I only de-risk positions by closing. Simply put: Why would I take on more risks when the probability of a bounce gets higher, the lower we draw down? This is why I scale in and out of trades; I do not add shorts on the way down, or add longs on the way up (These can work once or twice but it&amp;#x27;s not proper risk management, it&amp;#x27;s more akin to momentum VWAP day trading). I do not chase or fomo. These are lessons I learned early on in trading and a principle-based approach with my 7 Golden Rules of Trading (I wrote this myself 7 years ago). At best, I hedge with options or move closer to delta/gamma neutrality. In the long run, I must have positive expectancy to be an effective trader.</content>

      <content>This was before I slept. I think majority of my $SPY force closes are at 502-504. I sold 0DTE puts at 504 and 502 strike for little premiums &amp;lt; This was quite dumb but I was tired. My entry at 509. 61 was pretty good as I only suffered a 2. 5k drawdown to make close to 25k so far. Good 1:10 RR. Have some $NVDA shorts too!I dumped majority of my China positions as well as aggressively hedged the remainder of my long-term portfolio. I see potential for a small relief today. Should have traded some $VIX with a back call spread but I was also a little tired. Perhaps I should put more time into trading. Interesting how people think of $XAU $GLD as a market hedge but it&amp;#x27;s just been dumping alongside $BTC and $SPY as well. Might enter gold again soon.</content>

      <content>Kind of reminds me of the time I shorted $AXS from the top. There were bounces along the way. It&amp;#x27;s just easy for MMs or large players to buyback and kill shorters. Also, reminds me of how heavily propped up $NVDA has been. I much rather trade $SPY or $BTC as I am familiar with their IV. Once again, I might be wrong for trimming. However, I&amp;#x27;ve held these positions for 2 weeks now and they are still in the 5-6 digits. Enough for me. There&amp;#x27;s always another trade.</content>

You can see $NIO rallying today (China + EV) Longed 4. 9, Closing 7. 33. 300 Size, 1. 5k USDYou can see $NVDA dumping today(US + AI) Shorted from 910, Closing 625. 50 Size, 45k USDNext bigger play move would possibly be the gold long from 2255-2290 I will be bidding!</content>

      <content>Equities Wrap-upYesterday presented a lot of volatility in terms of earnings. One of the biggest movers was $CVNA. Despite their 40% move up; they still have what I believe to be negative earnings due to warrant markups to FMV on their stocks. I still think the valuations on a lot of US stocks are insane. It is merely propped up. It is extremely dangerous to short and a lot of people tend to short when it&amp;#x27;s flat &amp;amp; then die. (Ticker showed many margin calls on this yesterday). This is when I START to build a small short position or a bear debit spread on unsustained rallies like this on bad companies. Looks purely like a short squeeze. As it stands, I am still going to be shorting US Tech and long China AI ($BABA $BYD $NIO).</content>

      <content>Full Disclosure:I have taken close to 3-5 million in total trade volume the last 3 weeks &amp;amp; while I did make a good 60k. Upon my calculations, it simply would not even have outperformed just holding my 3000 shares of $BABA which I bought at a cost average of $69 (shown) &amp;amp; even giving the price target of $80 with the breakout on the May FOMC. I sold half of these on the way up, thinking I can deploy the margin to better use on other investments and re-enter my Chinese stocks. Sometimes you can predict everything but still poorly execute. Bear in mind, I was extremely on point with my $SPY &amp;amp; $BTC longs and shorts and yet I would still underperform a simple buy &amp;amp; hold strategy with 10x less equivalent risk undertaken in trade volume and opportunity cost. Granted 3000 shares in one stock is extremely high allocation because that would exceed 50% of my entire stock portfolio. That being said; profits are profits and there&amp;#x27;s always a next trade. Lesson in there.</content>

      <content>Was buying back heavily yesterday at $BABA 74. 60 and $KWEB 27. 85 ^. True conviction shows when you average up? They said to dollar cost average, they didn&amp;#x27;t say which direction üò´That being said, with the backdoor QE resuming based on FOMC Minutes, I am inclined to believe the US is going to allow inflation (at least at current levels) to devalue their debt. Gold $XAU should drop to 2260 approximately and that will mark the corresponding top in equities again with $BTC possibly even pushing past my 60. 8k target to extend into 62. 6-62. 9k.</content>

      <content>The only US stocks I feel are still undervalued are $PYPL and $META. Yes, even after a 500% move from the 80s, it&amp;#x27;s still not an expensive stock by any measure. Especially after the earnings drop on $META and the Tiktok ban. I will be accumulating these as well or at least selling puts. If you believe that the US economy will be fine, it&amp;#x27;s an easy buy at these prices. $CVNA bear spreads at the 145-165 levels are also a play. There&amp;#x27;s overhead resistance at the 200 SMA line, garbage stock by any measure that suffers from high rates, it&amp;#x27;s at fibo exhaustion levels, and we just had an ersatz short squeeze move up where insti shorts were forced to cover.</content>

      <content>Sharing a long-term trade setupHow to hedge the US MarketCounters: $TLT $SLV $SLJ $VIX $UVXY, etcLet me prephase this by saying the US equities market is simply still. . . overbought. I&amp;#x27;ve shorted this a few times but I had to be very precise with my levels. On the contrary, what are good hedge exposure for an equities portfolio aside from dangerously direct shorting. There&amp;#x27;s a very high R:R trade in $TLT if we ever get into a recession and the fed finally does cut; this can easily double or triple even. . I predict that a larger equities correction happens in June-August and at the bottom when banks fail/war strifes. The US is forced to devalue once again &amp;amp; resume QE. With lowered rates, long term yields then soar. Entry on these is in the $70-80 region. $SLV is also in a cup and handle and normally lags behind gold by 4-5 months (almost there with a bull flag/penant forming); with the gold-silver ratio at ATH of 87:1 now it is the most underpriced in over a century. This is normally manipulated by institution such as JP Morgan but a small holding might be in order. Aside from gold $GLD $XAU, miners in $NUGT $SILJ can be seen to be consolidating. Not $VIX $UVXY for beginners as leveraged contango kills you. For those more skilled, a timed call backspread works on these. Or just buy more China, Japan equities on pullback $HSI $CWEB $YIFF $A50 $1329 $9988, etc</content>

      <content>$SLV &amp;amp; $TLT have gone up 5% and 2% since I wrote this, I bought in at 24. 5 and 88 respectively. This US equities pump still seems extremely suspicious to me given its on the backdrop of record low volumes as well as defence stocks rising and oil still suppressed. There is a very peculiar and unusual correlation with these traditional risk-off assets rising (Gold, Silver, Bonds) alongside risk-on assets (Crypto, Stocks) rising as well!Rather than short heavily I am leaning towards just holding my holdings in $SLV $GLD $XAU bonds. I also think Crypto decouples from US equities and bull runs later on towards the year with rising inflation.</content>

      <content>Gamestop $GME halts trading yesterday and does over 100% over the previous days amidst Roaring Kitty resurgence from the ashes on X. There&amp;#x27;s technical upside here, but no fundamentals; essentially gambling. I wasn&amp;#x27;t in on this but still long on $BABA $NIO $JD and my $TLT $GLD $SLV from the bottom.

Other than these specific meme stocks $GME $AMC, I think $BNGO $CLOV (Chamath&amp;#x27;s SPACs  and Genomics phase) are some that I am watching the short interest and a retest of the 200MA, those have been clobbered the last few years.</content>

      <content>Market Colours today: Float is extremely bad on $GME, there is no fundamentals but I wouldn&amp;#x27;t short without stops given this has garnered sizable media attention with Roaring Kitty, Andrew Tate &amp;amp; media outlets now picking up on it. The fomo retail can be hard to predict. Most of the toppish action happened pre-market so you were unable to do puts as usual. $BABA also correcting hard after earnings. Continuing the trend of buy the rumour, sell the news with $META and $TSLA front-running their earning results and fading the news. Nothing too unexpected. Still bullish China as a whole! I also feel the bonds rising and risk-off assets rising along with a steepening yield curve still spells warning for US equities. Am on bear call spreads for $SPY under strike 530 and starting to sell cash secured puts back on the $BABA I sold.</content>

      <content>Another time where the PPI comes in extremely hot and US stock markets runs up. The last 3-4 times this happened we dump on the following CPI. I expect a rally in pre-markets and into the data release but a fade into the close. Coffee was removed from CPI metrics which makes me believe Inflation is indeed hot. Cleveland Nowcasting which generally has been a good precursor to the actual data has headline coming in at 3. 5%. Inflation is reaccelerating no doubt and I believe we get a 2nd run of Inflation like the 1970s and an eventual hard landing now after the election shennanigans.</content>

Not buying US equities here still aside from my tiny gambling positions in $CLOV, but selling credit spreads. I have rebought some $BABA today and yesterday as I was forced assigned previously to sell what I sold from my entry 68 at these prices.

      <content>^^^ Still the better play. Long bonds, gold, silver and China. Why buy overvalued US equities when the risk-free rate is so high on bonds, and 20Y treasuries can also appreciate in anticipation of easing conditions. Still in my $SLV from $24 and $TLT from $88. Only thing I have added back is $BABA. China is also starting to print, only difference is that they&amp;#x27;re actually undervalued unlike the US due to the China ADR Risk Premium basing it off either the DCF/PE models.</content>

      <content>Good bite yesterday to add more $BABA. I principally only buy on dips. All money printers are on and every country is basically outcompeting to devalue against their currency against another for competitive advantage. Once again, comes at the price of citizens losing their purchasing power. A lot of this has to do with the oil trade. Oil declines &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 10-year Treasury yield followsOil down + 10-year Treasury yield down &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Markets upKind of why you don&amp;#x27;t want to be long oil or short bonds.

      <content>I will once again still warn you about the US market right now. Yes, they are printing but this comes at the price of a heavily devaluing dollar; even when you peg it against the SMCI world or SG 30 Index. This is the same with the Yuan &amp;amp; Yen most recently. I also think the flows in $SMCI and $NVDA have the current potential to offer a stock split soon! A stock split offers smaller retail investors an opportunity to invest but also provides new exit liquidity. Generally, this is when the market retraces as when $TSLA led the reversal down in 2021 after their split. Not a hater, just being objective - that there are easier trades. Laser-eyes with China, cautiously bullish with US.</content>

      <content>My $XAU gold target is 3-3. 5k, but minimally 2. 6k. I think this comes along with an equities crash. It&amp;#x27;s been in this channel too long. Silver $SLV just has a higher beta and it normally catches up 6 months later. Lumber to gold ratio helps to predict up upcoming market correction as investors are flocking towards safe heaven. If the ratio plunge below zero it might show imminent market correction. $SPY could run to 540 to 600 based on the channel but this appears to be an election year blow off top as they print to erase debt, I would not direct short with current macro.</content>

      <content>If y&amp;#x27;all want a potentially stupid play right now. I think when $HSI China, $XAU Gold, $TLT Bond runs as I have repeatedly mentioned here till June FOMC. There is a heavy risk potential of US equities falling here. $QQQ and US tech to me will fall and mean revert down eventually. Drunkenmiller has already repositioned into Russ2000 or the small caps as laggards and sold his $NVDA shares. Once again, I am very cautious with my direct short timings. I don&amp;#x27;t play the $VIX $UVXY these days as I feel they suppress these. I am currently in a bear call spread on $QQQ and US equities.</content>

      <content>People tell me Silver $SLV is slow and I should buy Bitcoin but it&amp;#x27;s literally done 40% in the last 3 months when I first talked about it and $BTC has done nothing. That being said, I of course am bullish Bitcoin. I just like to find exponential returns. This was a pretty easy trade since gold ran already and Silver started showing signs of strength. Just know this chart is a 20 year long chart and people who bought Silver in 2011 are still not recovered while banks like UBS short it. Gold $XAU has ALREADY breached ATHs. Silver $SLV is next! My TP could even be something ridiculous like 59 if we do get a black swan event like 09.</content>

      <content>18. 7% up so far on my $XAG $SLV Silver. No longer adding here. China is buying. Major shifts in terms of currency wars. I am likely selling some of my $BABA on open today as I think it&amp;#x27;s too heavy of an allocation and I want to look for other opportunities for faster gains - ate the majority of the run-up already. In other news $NVDA reports earnings this Wednesday. Other than that there&amp;#x27;s only FOMC speakers the next few days in terms of economic data. Expecting a muted week, still holding my $QQQ $SPY bear call spreads as well!</content>

Looking to re-enter into my China Equities slowly now. I think $TLT&amp;#x27;s pullback is also good for cash secured puts and a buy soon.

      <content>The Indian Stock Market Crashes ü©∏The Indian Stock Market crashed today with one of the largest volatility move down in four years plunging 7% after Modi wins. Shares in Adani Enterprise plunge 25pc as prime minister‚Äôs party risks reduced majority. This marks as the WORST stock market dip on the day of the elections in the last 20 years. It&amp;#x27;s also the steepest decline of NIFTY &amp;amp; Bombay SENSEX since the Covid crash of 2020. Trading was suspended twice when the S&amp;amp;P BSE Sensex fell more than the 10% limit, the first time in the exchange‚Äôs history. This is reminiscent of what happened with the S&amp;amp;P during the 2020 Covid Crash as well. It&amp;#x27;s important to note that there is likely continuation to this move as did back then. History does not repeat but often rhymes. Why does this matter?I believe in the theory that markets move in boom and bust cycles. Liquidity will have to flow elsewhere as with Balance of Payments, Surpluses and Deficits. I am still betting on China. Source: Indian Markets Crash June 4th</content>

      <content>Indian Markets crashing massively. China Markets chopping. US markets and equities largely not moving due to no data these few days. Unemployment claims on Thursday should likely be moot also. I believe FOMC in June 11-12 should see us holding - Would be interesting if the Dot plot for 2024 policy rate goes to only one 25bp cut (from 3 forecasted previously). I think Banks and Bonds will benefit a lot from a cut eventually (Still buying into $TLT and $BMO Canadian/Montreal Bank on the dips, think Trudeau is messing up his country)Hence, also why I am opting for small shorts on $CVNA while holding larger bear call spreads on $QQQ and $SPY still. Been holding all these for a month now! Will start sell cash secured puts on $BABA soon!</content>

      <content>BREAKING: Bank of Canada cuts interest rates by 25 BPS, the first in the G7 to do so. Might be a precursor of what&amp;#x27;s to come with the June FOMC. This will likely lead to a 2nd run of Inflation and a Arthur Burns &amp;gt; Paul Volker scenario when it gets out of hand again. $BABA up 2% since yesterday. Bank of Montreal drops upon rate cuts. I think $BMO $SLV and $TLT are still a long if we get more cuts. Basically, long bonds, precious metals and banks.</content>

      <content>June FOMC Pre-fight Weigh-insPrima Facie, the US should cut due to bank pressures with bank rates already reflecting lowered FFRs along with election year posturing. However, with Reverse Repo running out and China selling U. S. Treasuries and Yellen having to pressure Japan (2nd largest holder of debt) to not dump treasuries at the cost of their own dying currency. There is a lot of pressure to keep rates high. Canada&amp;#x27;s cut is different as they are forced to save an economy which is 90% housing. Core inflation going crazy with a plummeting Loonie at the cost of saving the wealthy land owners. There&amp;#x27;s a reason Trudeau tested bank account seizers in Canada. Final Take:I believe we hold rates and there is a chance Every nation in the world will be cutting rates while the US holds them. This will cause currencies to collapse while the Dollar skyrockets, forcing nations to sell US Treasuries significantly below face value. Think the US still eventually cuts soon in the subsequent meetings.</content>

      <content>Call me crazy but I am getting bearish US equities again for a larger drop in the next few weeks. NVDA stock split on low outstanding shares propping up a narrow equities market, US Oil prices dropping 10%, Precious metals rallying, and finally rate cuts beginning the steepening of the deepest inverted yield curve in history. Once again, don&amp;#x27;t have to short, but I see the danger here. $TLT $SLV $SH still works. No $VIX for me.</content>

      <content>$TLT $SLV $XAU rallying while $SPY $NVDA slowing down as I predicted. I think a $NVDA stock split is bearish. Further given it carries most of the index right now. It is just propped up due to low float. Granted, $NVDA does have value and should not be compared to Cisco in the Dotcom Bubble, these levels are still extremely frothy. Remember what happened when $AAPL and $TSLA split a few years back? (Chart above)</content>

      <content>Bird flu is spreading and war tensions are getting high. Honestly no point buying bird flu stocks so pre-emptively as even if a pandemic happens, it would literally stiffle production, and spread fear such that money would be pulled out of the system anyway. Same goes for China stocks &amp;amp; Precious Metal, I like them for valuations but I did take some profits and sold calls to hedge from my initial 300k shares in $BABA $KWEB $SLV already. Will look to buy more after the US equities market dips as I believe there&amp;#x27;s a contagion effect. Patience! ü§ôüèº</content>

      <content>What&amp;#x27;s happening with Tesla$TSLA currently is in one of the tightest bands and wedges. Aside from the broader market being overbought, massive competition from China in the EV space, and rate cuts happening. With the Tesla shareholder&amp;#x27;s meeting 1 week away to decide on the 56 Billion Dollars Remuneration Package, it‚Äôs decision time for the stock. If shareholders vote no and Musk goes, price tanks. I can even see $TSLA going to the $60-80 support if this happens. If Musk stays, The cult props up the share price. But you give him the shares and he might still dump the other portion of his stock anyway and tanks the price. Both cases look bearish to me. I am just being objective here. I am not a perma-bear, I even took the longs from $130 to $200 if you scroll up. With this whole time it‚Äôs been chop, I still made money elsewhere in the meantime and now I am finally re-looking at $TSLA. 2 Plays here:(1) Long Vega with a Bull Strangle, to bet on a volatility move. (Safer)(2) Buy OTM Calls or Puts (Yolo)With volatility so cheap here, I might even think a yolo play to buy OTM Puts at $80 is good just as insurance. A 20th¬†Sep $85 Put costs only $0. 40Source: Decision Time for Tesla</content>

      <content>TLDR; $BYD &amp;gt; $TSLAI was long $TSLA from $140 to $200and then I flipped short from $195 targeting $165-175 region which we are at now. I have mentioned I closed during both instancesOnce the chunk of the move is done, you simply get out. Sure I could have held that $195 short, but that&amp;#x27;s capital I don&amp;#x27;t have to deploy in other trades in my Silver, China plays. This week is the time to look at $TSLA again. I am sorry to perma bulls, but the headwinds might be too strong on this one. I think $TSLA has ran its course and a lot of perceived value is only because of Musk at the helm. If he leaves, I expect the shares to tank - I am looking at under $80 frankly. For context, Koguan Leo is the 3rd largest individual shareholder of Tesla. He lives in Singapore and also voted no to Elon&amp;#x27;s pay package inciting him to leave.</content>

      <content>NVIDIA splits today$NVDA has gone through 5 stock splits that preceded a major correction1999: 2-for-1 split &amp;gt; Correction2000: 2-for-1 split &amp;gt; Correction2001: 2-for-1 split &amp;gt; Dot Com2006: 2-for-1 split &amp;gt; Housing Crisis 2021: 4-for-1 split &amp;gt; Covid-19 PandemicIs this coincidental rather than causal? A lot has to do with NVIDIA being a high-beta, high growth tech stock. Hence, whenever the market gets too frothy, boards naturally opt to split. $NVDA 10/1 split will make the float from 2. 5 to 25 billion shares. NVIDIA is severely hard-carrying the indices right now. To put things into perspective‚Ä¶NVIDIA Market Capitalisation: $2. 97 trillion Brazil GDP: $2. 2 trillionThe US and NVIDIA currently still has the ability to ‚Äútransform‚Äù ersatz asset bubble wealth into real wealth, because it can ‚Äústeal‚Äù other nations‚Äô productive capacity via dollar hegemony. Is this a bubble? Idts, but it‚Äôs overpriced due to limited supply and slow competitors to disrupt the monopoly.</content>

      <content>Elections &amp;amp; Rate Cuts happening Globally but the devil is in the details!We have just seen Mexico&amp;#x27;s Election, followed by India, and now Eu and next UK on July 4th followed by the US. If you&amp;#x27;re noticing a trend that rates are cut right as election comes, you&amp;#x27;re right!The risk premiums of France, Italy, Austria, and Spain over Germany are widening significantly because the EU is not only coming under pressure from the outside following the growth of right-wing populists, but internal cracks are also becoming apparent. Bond Prices across Europe are rising today. In a matter of who cuts first - by the US Feds delaying cuts till their elections, it holds their bonds suppressed (see TLT) and allows the dollar to strengthen further. If the dollar rips, guess what happens to risk-assets like Bitcoin and US Tech for now?</content>

      <content>Here&amp;#x27;s a history of the most recent stock split performance of the Mag 7 to give you an idea where $NVDA might be headed in the interim:$TSLA Aug 25th 2022: Next 6 days -12%$AAPL Aug 28th 2020: Next 3 days +10%, Following 3 days -20%$AMZN June 3rd 2022: Next 6 days -21%$GOOG July 18th 2022: Next 3 days +3%, Following 4 days -10%$MSFT: Feb 18th 2003: Next 17 days -10%Even when shorting you don&amp;#x27;t hold the position more than 1-2 weeks. Just because drops happen a lot faster than climbs!Still bullish after this long flush. Extreme worst case for $BTC would be in the 40-50s imo. Up only after that!</content>

      <content>Sharing some of my thought process with a friend as to why I shorted 71. 2k and called for this TP at 66k and the bounce. There was a lot of ersatz support along the way but I chose the one where most leveraged longs die (a 5-10% drop on $BTC and 20-40% on alts liquidates most leveraged positions of 10-20x; the default). Supports are chosen on a combination of demand zones, liquidity, dark pools and max pain options. I can&amp;#x27;t say for sure where is the true bottom as I cannot be predicative or am privy as to how inefficiently markets are priced and what CPI/FOMC brings this week. I have always just made my best guess. Why do we need to tap lows before the run-up?While the financial markets are not a zero-sum game and are priced upwards due to stimulus and irresponsible J Pow prints, they cannot allow high leveraged longs to run-up on derivatives, and they have to lower longs by either funding/decay or a liquidation hunt. In the long-run, due to the nature of Bitcoin, we are destined for 100k+.</content>

More importantly, officials are mixed on the dot plot with 2, 1 &amp;amp; no rate cuts for this year all still on the table. Should be range and chop for awhile before we climb the wall of worry.

      <content>Same chart on $BTC as above, there&amp;#x27;s probably a smaller elliot wave within the Wave 5 down. I&amp;#x27;ve talked about this final Wave 5 down before. When the stochastic oscillators validate the swing failure top then we can potentially push for the final move to 55k. Bullish as long as we hold that HTF support. I presume $SPY US Equities should do a blow-off top then as well. Coincides with fractals and risk assets bottoms likely with CPI/PPI news on July 11/12th. Heavily dependent on the Inflation Data having to show slowing.</content>

      <content>Granted I was a little late, stacking $BTC orders at 57. 2-57. 4k after validation when I should have entered more at 56k levels (original plan) for a better entry. Was out today and I was drinking. I guess that&amp;#x27;s also what makes trading sustainable. I still need to workout, have a life, but I lock-in when I need to.

      <content>Interesting how the Dollar $DXY is weakening. I sus-ed out the move to close my longs during that Powell speech (above^) where he leaned dovish and posited starting the easing cycle later this year; leading to a strong reversal down of the dollar strength. Crypto has since depegged from tradfi equities market with the stock market $SPY $QQQ still rallying while Crypto $BTC falls with Dollar Strength and Hegemony. Is this the time where we consider Crypto&amp;#x27;s potential status as a reserve currency instead of a risk asset?</content>

      <content>TLDR; Crypto is more correlated to the dollar now as opposed to risk tech assets. Additionally, it&amp;#x27;s a simple case of more supply than demand causing downward price action with Mt Gox, ETFs, Halving, Germany Central Banks selling Crypto inducing selling pressure on Crypto. $BTC bottoms when $SPY $QQQ tops in that case.</content>

      <content>Gonna consider some of my levered $BTC positions earlier at B, 57. 3-58. 1k just based off PA, I don&amp;#x27;t like this move. Too fast. Not a true bottom. Needs fear for a more prolonged period. Seems like just a relief rally on a VIX crush Friday with dip buyers on low volume and no economic data. I don&amp;#x27;t think the Banks have finished selling. Will close levered positions at B and reassess data over the weekend. A little tired.</content>

      <content>US Markets FrothI&amp;#x27;ll do a further analysis on the US equities market but we&amp;#x27;re very frothy right now esp on Big Tech. Just been green day after green day. I&amp;#x27;m too cautious to buy longs/calls here as I can&amp;#x27;t control what happens during the non-US zones and I feel 0DTE can cause it to fall any moment so I don&amp;#x27;t want to be caught offside. Only way I would play this is on futures/CFDs where I can put a SL perpetually at the cost of incurring swap fees. Alternatively I could buy OTM puts for insurance on current positions. $VIX isn&amp;#x27;t even a hedge anymore due to vol suppression. Not shorting atm but waiting for supply levels. This might be hard to understand for some as normally I try to dumb it down to make it easier to understand as my thinking is normally wired a bit differently lol.</content>

Not sure on D because Powell could say anything on Tuesday tbh. Downtrend still intact and if equities flip, crypto will be pulled down with it. Especially since with the introduction of $BTC ETFs, deleveraging/liquidation cascades can still occur on the insti side. If it&amp;#x27;s not clear already, I have taken profits at 57. 8-58. 1k like I repeatedly said and I have stops at my entries from the lows.

      <content>That being said, I think after the D move on $BTC we go down to green zone 48. 5k (will analyse this later).

      <content>No US tech for me, my thesis is that it will rotate into other sectors, $IWM, Small caps, China. I cannot buy here when down-side risk is so high. My Silver and Gold up 3% &amp;amp; 2% today! This is just runaway inflation at this point with the dollar devaluing and Yellen dropping stimmy bazookas. Crypto likely chops here and runs up to 100k eventually. Time is a way to weed out weak hands. I am just going to hold my $BTC spot. Still holding my 1 BTC from 54. 4k.

      <content>$TLT will likely rally upon rate cuts. Lower rates = Bond price appreciation. Likely comes with an equities pullback and ending of USDJPY carry trade. the $NQ and $USDJPY chart looks exactly similar because Japan is simping for the US economy by choosing to bail out Fed spending by holding their debt. I think most Japanese are too old &amp;amp; subservient to realise their purchasing power is siphoned away while they work till 100+ (they live that long anyway and barely travel out). Bank of Japan&amp;#x27;s Ueda is royally screwing their citizens by continuing to hold US debt while others like China and BRICs move away from the USD hegemony üëÄ (Japan now largest holder of Debt after China dumped, YCC Yield Curve Control abandoning in March to attempt to posit to be restrictive ended up futile)Nikkei in melt-up mode now because it&amp;#x27;s dollar denominated and the Yen is dying even further.

      <content>Yes, the $QQQ and $SPY can continue to go up. Basically everything is a melt-up if we&amp;#x27;re loosening policies. Markets are priced upwards. However, it&amp;#x27;s more likely better and safer profits in a broader based index $DJI $IWM, even $TLT. Why $TLT? Again, when the supply of short-term debt instrument through issuance slows. Rate cuts would make short-term interest rates lower than long-term ones. Generally, bonds with long maturities and low coupons have the longest durations. These bonds are more sensitive to a change in market interest rates and thus are more volatile in a changing rate environment. TLDR, cut in Fed Funds Rate, TLT Booms üöÄ</content>

      <content>What I learned with trading is that economic data/fundamental analysis is useless in the shorter time frame; just trade price action, momentum and use technical analysis. Unless you&amp;#x27;re investing and in a bear market, data is rigged at these levels. How often do we see unemployment data revised? or Markets ignore PPI, CPI, PMI. How do we value a company when PE forward PE is 40-70 right now on US tech. Data days are only important to fade moves and monitor volatility.</content>

      <content>Nikkei NI225 gaps down 2% on the open. Very likely due to the carry trade unwinding. US Printed a cool CPI report inducing higher likelihoods of rate cuts in the dot plot and lower yield on the carry trade. Since dollar weakens, and yen strengthens. This directly weakens Japanese equities market. Further noting that it has also been overbought for a few days now just like the US. Many factors to play. But also why I was watching the Yen last night with my previous write-up!</content>

      <content>^ thesis was that equities would unwind with CPI and this would pull down $BTC. As perfect as my last 10 runs been, it&amp;#x27;s difficult to time it perfectly so if you want to buy back slightly earlier so be it. Anything under 50k for $BTC should be fine!If you got good entries then you watch the bounce strength and if oscillators validate continuation. If bad entries then bopez.

If you go on a positional trade play, and the worst I can see $BTC going is 44-48k and my TP is 100k+, that&amp;#x27;s still enough of a odds ratio given my win rate to get positive expectancy in the long-term.

      <content>Reason I didn&amp;#x27;t sell my spot I bought at the lows and am not selling now yet either. Trump doesn‚Äôt tilt his head at the last second and we would have gotten 50k $BTC / 2. 5k $ETH. Nobody can predict this market fully. By at least selling the $BTC highs at 72k and targeting 53. 8k I likely already saved myself from a lot of pain, unrealised losses and possible capitulation/paper handedness. A lot easier to hold the 53-54k buys when you shorted from 72k, are sitting in profits to buffer, and unscathed from the drop. Eventually we go to 105-110k $BTC one day. I will sell fully there.</content>

      <content>I was trading 15-20 $BTC size like 2 years ago^ (albeit with mark price at 40k-60k, that&amp;#x27;s about 800k - 1. 2 mil margin) and trading 1. 5-2 $BTC size now. On an IV and ATR standpoint we used to move 3-10% per days sometimes back then, I think movements are smaller now with more institutional adoption. Just restarting from a smaller account with less leverage for better mental health. I am barely watching this trade tbh, perhaps better this way. I have also hedged my main holdings on the cold wallet with covered calls like I said.</content>

      <content>Waiting for this on $QQQ as well. Went short at 497 with 1. 5 million at first but pussied out and closed 90% already. Honestly this was my worst close. Think I miscalculated my size and missed out on a ton of profits. Holding the remainder down :( I did have bear call spreads about 1 month ago as well on $SPY if you guys recalled. I believe this drops down further with September seasonality lows &amp;amp; FOMC as the impetus. I still expect China, Commodities, Long bonds to run-up into the late stage of the year after that.</content>

      <content>Already at the flip short range. . . Only took 4 hours to get to 65k. Let me relook the flows. I do a smaller standard 1-2 $BTC size now. Maybe i&amp;#x27;ll try make it back on the leaderboards but I haven&amp;#x27;t traded crypto full-time in about 2 years man. I just held spot through the bullrun. With 2-3x Leverage it requires me 6 moves of 10% or more to make 60% returns. Based on daily adjusted IV &amp;amp; ATR this means the average daily move is about 2k or 3%. Not ruling out $BTC to 44-48k completely like I said if equities and the BoJs rate hikes, etc force a liquidity run-off.</content>

      <content>USDSGD currently 1. 32. Result of the carry trade unwinding. We&amp;#x27;re in heavy bear market territory now for equities. Could see $QQQ to 405 as well. $TLT as I said also booming up since I called it at sub 90. $BTC is iffy because if you see it as similar to gold i&amp;#x27;m bullish. Yet if you see it as risk-on like $NVDA then I am bearish. That&amp;#x27;s why I am on more inbetween on it and just betting it&amp;#x27;s heavy chop. With temporal headwinds pushing it to 40-50k again.</content>

      <content>This was correct in the end ^, so I just executed my long closes and flipped short. Should have just believed the 65. 5k resistance level like I initially predicted but an average of 64. 8k is good enough. Once again, not perfect because I am not a robot and I need to sleep unfortunately. So far shorted 70k to 53khttps://t. me/realisedgainsanalysis/1735Flipped long 53k to 70khttps://t. me/realisedgainsanalysis/1815Shorted 70k to 62. 5khttps://t. me/realisedgainsanalysis/1852Flipped long 62. 5 to 65khttps://t. me/realisedgainsanalysis/1911Flipped shorted 65k to new lows. . . Might take awhile this one! Once again, all are just ideas and I put my money where my mouth is so my money can feed my mouth. Don&amp;#x27;t kpkb if I am wrong.</content>

      <content>Not going 44-48k immediately btw, I expect 58k to hold. Will reassess there ü´° ^^^ probably looks like the chart above but D likely lower. Possibly to 58-59k then to 61-62k then chop a few days then 44-48k for $BTC. Please search in chat $BTC / $QQQ / $TLT $SLV $XAG $GLD $XAU if you want to see specific charts.

      <content>Discretionary traders typically rely on trading techniques and strategies that generally have room for interpretation such as chart pattern analysis, support and resistance, Elliott wave, Fibonacci analysis, cyclical analysis and more. Systematic traders require more empirical or mathematical based data which can be programmed into an algorithm. As such, system traders will generally utilize technical indicators such as Stochastics, Williams %R, Average True Range, and more. Additionally they may use price smoothing indicators such as moving averages and price bands such as Keltner channels, or Bollinger Bands. I&amp;#x27;ve always been more discretionary than systematic. There is no room for hesitation in the market. Generally this is why, I choose to avoid alcohol, run/workout to train my tolerance for pain. The best trades tend to be the most painful ones. You call it &amp;quot;brave&amp;quot;, I call it contrarian. Drawdowns are purely a didactic exercise to test your measure as a man.</content>

      <content>Just sold some 56k cash secured puts at 59k $BTC, with 3 day strike (24/08/06) to move it less delta negative. Essentially means if it breaks 56k in 3 days I need to TP half my position. Pretty bad premiums with only $200-300 collected but I am trying options on Crypto. Still holding original position size. We&amp;#x27;re at the 58. 4-58. 8k support I want already. Just broke under 60k earlier!</content>

      <content>I would argue that the difference this time round is we have the longest steepening yield curve uninversion in history after an unabated period of quantitative easing coupled with the fact with the unwinding of the USDJPY Carry Trade after decades of building up, along with war tensions every other day. Unprecedented times. Either way I am bearish for 1-2 months into this seasonality weakness. Still very bummed I TP-ed so much of my equities one early. Had close to 1. 5 million USD in shorts and left with 100k USD now. I need more stoicism in the future. Holding all my shorts.</content>

      <content>Fear is the mind killer. Nobody talks about the psychological aspect of trading enough. It&amp;#x27;s just digits on a screen but why do we feel so different with 5 digits vs 7 digits on the line. It&amp;#x27;s probability, permutations and expectancy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done a lot of thinking about fear.

      <content>This might be the most painful period for most investors why? You both lose in USD valuation (weakening DXY) and lower net asset value, NAV (crashing equities and risk assets). No emergency rate cuts till much deeper. Only thing that will be going up is gold, silver and long-dated bonds. I have mentioned this many times. Was slightly early, but not wrong. I&amp;#x27;ve been mentioning July/August for a drop for awhile if you scroll up. - Hamas top leader Ismail Haniyeh killed on Iranian soil. - Hezbollah leader Shukr killed in Israeli airstrikes in Beirut. - BOJ emergency rate hikes. Unprecedented times of strife.</content>

      <content>The most I opened was a 110 BTC short 2 years ago at 60k, so that was like 6. 6 million USD size with 400k margin, but I was a different person back then. No risk management and basically irresponsibly sliding the margin up. I could defo get away with it given how precise my entries and exits have been and I don&amp;#x27;t think my heart could take that anymore. Chance of ruin is much higher the greater your leverage is. He&amp;#x27;s basically using 210k capital to open 32 BTC (2 million USD) in notional size, that&amp;#x27;s 8. 83x leverage. Given $BTC regularly daily moves 2-5% based on IV/ATR. He doesn&amp;#x27;t actually have much to work with. Still wondering if he&amp;#x27;s actually bad, hedging on another account or using a fake ByBit referral account. He&amp;#x27;s actually going to be liquidated for the full 210k capital at 56098. Liquidation cascade down moving really fast now.</content>

      <content>I also temporarily removed discussion and most reactions because I don&amp;#x27;t want to engage with anybody tbh. I am just here to share my trade ideas, not here to debate, argue or pander my opinions in an echo chamber. I truly love this volatility though, I managed to eat a lot of the moves from the first 70k down to 53k and back up to 70k and all the way down to here; including all the small moves in between. Volatility is so lucrative for a trader. Managed to let the winners run as well. Very good R:R.</content>

      <content>Storytime; and hopefully a lesson to some new traders out there. Back in 2018-2020 when I was trading in college and university, I shorted $BTC ($XBT on Bitmex) from 11k to 7k. Then in March 2020 during the covid crash it dropped from 8k to 3. 6k in 1 day. I bought $BTC at 5k thinking it was cheap and got liquidated at 3. 6k. This was the same day oil went negative. I remembered the entire order books being empty, they had to shut down exchange sites perhaps because Market Makers needed time to create orders. And then years later, I shorted Crypto from Jan 2022 at 68k to 18k (Check the chat) on FTX and I did managed to withdraw most of it but have still money stuck inside. That being said, today on 5th August i&amp;#x27;m still going to TP some at 44-48k $BTC out of principle : ) It&amp;#x27;s not always about maximising profits, and minimising losses, it&amp;#x27;s about staying in the game.</content>

      <content>Could you survive a bear market anon?I preface a biblical crash because you have to zoom out and see how absurd and ersatz this entire run-up has been, on the backbone of not just tightening condition but fake backdoor easing through the Treasury General Account (TGA), Reverse Repo and Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). I never flipped short or shouted overbought till only 1-2 months back, I have always leaned on July - September seasonality weakness in line with the rate cuts being bearish for a pivot to bail out - slightly early but in the grand scheme of things, these are the decisions that save you. Taiwan stock market TSE worst selloff since 1967, Nikkei worst since 1987 Black Monday, US Tech about to do the same, $QQQ opens at 432. While look at China! Down a lot less, and Xi Jin Ping does have the conditions to stimulate if they want to or flip the USDCNY hegemony. I get that you think oh, it&amp;#x27;s cheap, let&amp;#x27;s buy the dip, let&amp;#x27;s catch this falling knife. Hence, why I shared that storytime post above. Study history, learn from my past mistakes. This time is different, only that it is faster - due to 0DTE. We are not at capitulation yet.</content>

      <content>$QQQ to 369-397, $BTC to 44-48k, $SPY to 468-472. Minimally these levels to even consider longs. ^ Wrote this awhile back. Easier to buy the dip when you just closed a short and have profits to buffer, at least psychologically. We still have not seen funds, exchanges and banks blow up. Those are the days you buy. This is just a standard liquidation cascade. As to why, Gold Silver or China is also dropping? Generally you have to realise that when big funds unwind their position, they have to sell everything or risk getting margin called. In doing so, gold will see a temporary pullback. When stocks bottom, $TLT peaks, gold $XAU generally lags and silver lags even further $XAG, these are generally not as liquid, but will drop as well, and will resurge after.

      <content>$QQQ bouncing above 438-442 already^! Cash Covered Puts now in profits. I am expecting a chop around this region for a few weeks before a 2nd drop. I don&amp;#x27;t think bull run comes until September seasonality is over. If you recall I shorted $BTC from the top at 70k and also sold covered calls for a 2 month expiration there. $VIX being high yesterday means IV was high, but today that same $VIX has retraced back from 70 to 25 approx, killing premiums from both calls and puts. Hence, why selling options is still undefeated. As of now, I am still expecting a further drop later on into September. Let the volatility reset and then we continue with another leg of a drop is my 2 cents. BoJ Ueda is just succumbing to temporary political pressure after their rate hike. &amp;quot;Now the BoJ is clearly under pressure to respond to the market selloff  and to justify its hawkish policy decision&amp;quot; - UBS</content>

      <content>Based on this chart^, the next to spike in my opinion would be $GLD $XAU $XAG. Silver is now trading back at 26$/ounce. Faster returns would be $TLT but safer returns would be commodities, with oil also showing recession risk. I&amp;#x27;ll break this one down soon but keep a look out on these!

      <content>I like $SLV $XAG at 25. 7-25. 3 if we get there. Would be a great entry imo. Positional trade play. Or just sell cash secured puts since it&amp;#x27;s only $23-24 on $SLV silver trust, it would only requite 2. 5k margin to pull this off. I would go out a few months expiration because I think that a drop would cause an IV spike which you should capitalise to collect premiums. Another alternative is a long call ladder or a call back ratio strategy.</content>

      <content>Was watching the break of structure at 62k if y&amp;#x27;all were following. That was the 0. 618 golden resistance and supply zone from previous support before the initial drop. Unpopular opinion: I think $BTC will likely act with gold this time and enter the bullrun LATER only in December perhaps during the Santa Claus rally/lower volume season. I think when the Yield Curve inverts fully capital will flow out of most assets from stocks into Bonds, Gold, Commodities.</content>

      <content>Market normally taps liquidity top before a drop and vice versa. You had another opportunity to enter shorts at 61. 8k yesterday. With TP at 58. 3/57. 3k (that&amp;#x27;s a $4. 5k down move). Place SL slightly below latest high (62. 4k would be $800 away). At least a 1:4 risk:reward trade.

      <content>U. S. Stocks and Bond Yields are now in sync, and correlating. Which means that going forward, further weakness in the economy or inflation will implode stocks. In the past, good news was good news and bad news was good news. This is not the case now. With the yield curve un-inversion steepening, this means that short-term rates are expected to fall and this only happens when something in the economy is threatening to break. I said it before, rate cuts are not bullish; they are an emergency measure.</content>

      <content>Hindsight bias, but I should have bought more direct shares as opposed to cash secured puts for $QQQ at 432-438-442 like I identified as support for $QQQ above. Cash secured puts means it&amp;#x27;s not very delta positive and I only collected premiums largely from this run-up. Spread trading can be quite profitable if volatility is spiking again though. $BABA closing flat after earnings is also suspicious. Generally the last few economic data have always seen the moves play out like this: Cleveland Inflation (pre-cursor) &amp;gt; CPI (fade) &amp;gt; PPI (real move) &amp;gt; Retails Sales/Earning (extended move).</content>

      <content>When to use Log Scaling in Charting?There are two main reasons to use logarithmic scales in charts and graphs (Option + L on TradingView). The first is to respond to¬†skewness/kurtosis towards large values; i. e. , cases in which one or a few points are much larger than the bulk of the data. The second is to show percent change or multiplicative factors. How to use ATR to place stop losses. For a weekly trade. Given current $BTC Weekly ATR is 7000, using an SL at 1. 5x ATR that‚Äôs 10500. Given downwards move have a higher volatility skew, and we can escape drops to be faster on average than rises. For instance, if targeting TP 44-46k, we should place SL for shorts at approx 69k (= 57300+10500) given mark price of 57. 3k. Not great R:R, we‚Äôre at 1:1 now.

      <content>$VIX now at 14. 81 from 64 2 weeks ago. In an average volatility regimes it would take 4-6 months to retrace what it has done in the last 2 weeks. Closest reference would be in 1994-2000 we had a 12x run on NDX with 10-20% and even 40% pullbacks during a period following fed hikes and soft cuts. Volatility was the cost of trading during these periods. However, not at such obscene valuations. So much for the FED&amp;#x27;s second mandate of price stability.</content>

Like I mentioned, I still believe in $NIO and I think $MLCO is a probably swing trade as well. This all comes with the weakening US dollar!</content>

      <content>I am back in $NIO &amp;amp; $MLCO here as well from 3. 83 and 5. 18 ^^^ posted above. Will be looking for a double-up on these. These are both China/Asia exposure. The latter being a casino group with chains in Macau and Phillipines, they announced nearly a US$45mln share buy back 21 hours ago. Pretty good timing for both these buys. With $NIO now trading at 4. 09 in it&amp;#x27;s $9866 HK Market counterpart, and $MLCO at 5. 55!</content>

      <content>Good close for $BTC shorts at 56. 6k here last Thursday^^. $VIX still being crushed for equities means we might tap resistance at 63-64k at the upper extreme in this lull period. Still in my $BTC spot bag. I currently am only use futures to hedge spot. Think this moves happen nearer to unemployment claims, Powell&amp;#x27;s speech and the Jackson Hole Symposium on Saturday.

      <content>I still think Crypto $BTC continues to go up till Thursday/Friday, this goes for equities as well, with the dollar dropping, USDSGD now at 1. 30xx. No news is good news. I would take profit for $BTC at red region 63. 8-65. 9k if on leverage. While I am cautious of weaker seasonality in September. This year might potentially  play out like 2007 when the FED lowered rates after their hiking cycle on . . . 9/18! S&amp;amp;P rallied from mid-Aug to the top on Oct 11, 2007. Market rallied 3% from the first 50 bp cut on 9/18/07 then topped on 10/11/07. It then rallied 1% from the 25 bp cut on 10/31/07. After that it was game over. One last hurrah. I am still going to be betting that bonds will outperform stocks in the next few years, hence why I am still in $TLT and China.</content>

      <content>I drew this almost a year ago ^^^ thinking $SPY would push to 525 from the lows of 380 where I first longed. I took all my profits at 525 and have not bought back US since then. Never thought I would be thinking 590-600 now. Yet I think we&amp;#x27;re getting there now. TLDR; rate cuts to me are bearish because they are meant to fix and throw a lifeline to a dying market. The first cuts however normally come with emerging problems and the market can still run upwards off the backs of temporary stimulus and buy the dippers before it does a harder correction. So give or take if history rhymes again and this is a 07 scenario with consumer debt unwinding, a further 3% rise can bring $SPX to 5900-6050/$SPY to 590-605 area +- 1-2 percent where we top for the year. All speculation ofc.</content>

      <content>I am not leveraged on any of these positions. $QQQ and $SPY have unwinded all the dovish talk gains in the last 30 minutes. On a larger time frame we are still overbought so the max I can see $BTC going is 63-65k. However, I will be bearish if we do not break those levels by September. A more straightforward play I am also doing would still be long gold or bonds though. The issue with cutting rates in the September 17/18 FOMC Meeting is that it can possibly reignite inflation and undo the work over the last 2 years. Powell is a master artisan. Wealth inequality has broken new records since 2008. Housing affordability is at an all time LOW &amp;amp; he essentially says the fix is more QE. There will come a point that the bottom 50% is going to get really loud. However, it is still an election year and numbers are still being doctored as I mentioned with the Jobs data a few days back.</content>

      <content>Why Rate Cuts can be bearish?First Rate Cut - Jan 3, 2001 (Dot Com Bubble)- S&amp;amp;P 500 fell ~39% next 448 days- Unemployment rose another 2. 1%First Rate Cut - Sep 18, 2007 (Sub-prime Mortgage Crisis)- S&amp;amp;P 500 fell ~54% next 372 days- Unemployment rose another 5. 3%First Rate Cut - Sep 18, 2024 (AI Hype)- ?- ?Extending the sample size we have 1995, 1998, and 2019, check this out. In all 3 of those examples, unemployment was trending down. 2019 was at a 50-year low. Every other time when unemployment was trending up (as is now) and we saw rate cuts, it led to a sell off in equities and a continued climb in unemployment rate. I talked about this on the Youtube Video as well!</content>

      <content>$CVNA is over 5 billion in debt trading at $156 now with a 32 Billion Market Cap. If we get rate cuts (and we should). I think this tops here. VERY VERY speculative play to short an individual counter but there&amp;#x27;s good R:R here. However, I think a safer play is still long $TLT $IQD $IEI. Also think Gold will behave like in the last cycles, pulling back initially on rate cuts. Long-dated bonds will react directly up first while gold/bitcoin should give a pull-back before rising.</content>

      <content>Would The Crash Be Bigger Than 2008?Markets are irrational. Feeling like the US markets are constantly being propped up by the Fed because the economy is so much more dependent on asset prices than it was back then. If the stock market went down by 50% in let&amp;#x27;s say Singapore noone would even know. If the S&amp;amp;P went down 50% it would be complete meltdown of the economy. Keeping the &amp;quot;numbers up&amp;quot; seem more important even it means a lower standard of living for the average Joe. I think we will see a repeat of an increase in wealth gap which will benefit people with assets and put the poor at an even bigger disadvantage.

Claudia Sahm created it as a way to time the onset of recessions. The rule states that when the 3-month moving average of the unemployment rate is 0. 5% higher than the lowest 3-month moving average of the preceding 12 months, a recession is likely (but not guaranteed).

      <content>INTEL faces delisting from Dow as Stock sinks furtherMarkets took a big hit today (4/9/24) on August ISM data, with tech and risk assets falling further. Including the after hours decline, $NVDA&amp;#x27;s drop marks the largest single day loss of market cap for a stock in history. Speculation is growing also that Intel (INTC) will be delisted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average as the microchip company‚Äôs stock continues to decline. Intel was one of the first technology companies to join the Dow index back in 1999 at the height of the dot-com stock market rally. It has been a member of the Dow for 25 consecutive years. However, the Reuters news agency is reporting that Intel‚Äôs status in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now under threat after the company‚Äôs share price has declined 54% this year. Intel is not only the worst performer in the Dow, an index of 30 blue-chip stocks that‚Äôs meant to represent a cross-section of the U. S. economy, it is also the second-worst performing stock in the benchmark S&amp;amp;P 500 index this year. Reminds me of the time ExxonMobil $XOM was delisted from the DOW in 2021 to mark the final point of capitulation before it resurged. As a contrarian, de-listment to me is bullish üòÇ Source: $INTC -4. 80%</content>

      <content>U. S. AUGUST NONFARM PAYROLLS RISE BY 142,000; EST. 164,000; PREV. 89,000. US JOB NUMBERS HAVE BEEN REVISED DOWN by a MASSIVE 818,000 for the 12 months through March 2024As a result, monthly payroll gains were lowered by ~68,000 a month on average to 174,000 from initially reported 242,000. Gave the support to close shorts for $BTC shorts from 64. 9k at 55. 2k earlier yesterday. Will be looking at a relief rally possible overextending here after the jobs data miss. $QQQ $SPY $NQ $ES will also relief. Longer-term trend still down for the month imo.</content>

      <content>^ Based on Elliot Wave 3 Impulse on the Image above. This down move for $QQQ $BTC is not over but I think the dark green regions are your first buys. E may not happen if it does not complete the full 5 count wave. So around C I will start flipping long. I&amp;#x27;ve said this before but that will be 44-41-37k for $BTC and sometime for $QQQ $SPY when $VIX hits 35+. I don&amp;#x27;t know exact levels for sure until I watch the flow on the day itself.</content>

      <content>Apple and Google Hit With Huge Fines!Apple just lost a ‚Ç¨13 billion tax battle, and Google was fined ‚Ç¨2. 4 billion for unfair practices in Europe. These costs could be a small pinch to their financial performances and profit margins, and hence stock price performance. This is amidst fierce battles from competitors including Baidu and Huawei too. One way to mitigate this is to transfer some of these costs over to consumers via higher product prices. Either ways a lose-lose; if you are holding shares or wanting to buy your next iphone. üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èSource: Apple and Google Face Major Defeats in EU Court Battles</content>

      <content>Update on Positions:If we do get a push re-break ATHs coming into the elections, I think $SPY could go to 590-605^ for next resistance as what i said here, but I am fairly certain either way that most of my other entries on individual counters here will hold. To me the lows of $NIO at 3. 83 where I bought in will not be touched and I have said I am looking for a double up on this. I have also said $CVNA at 156 would go to zero eventually but I am obviously not holding this short to zero, I will likely be out of majority of the positions at around 81-92. This would be close to a 50% drop and good enough for me. I did finally close some of my $BTC short positions from 64. 9k at 54. 3k-55. 2k as per my screenshots here but looking for re-shorts. Will still hold the $TLT and $XAU $GLD longs as I believe US rate cuts will push this up and further unwind the currency carry trade; with BoJ hiking and the jobs report pushing further rate cut pressures on the US Feds dot plot.</content>

      <content>2024 Presidential Debate LIVE now:Generic ballot update: By the time Biden dropped out, Republicans had gained a narrow lead. Today, Democrats are up by about 2¬Ω points. Via ABC News 538:Major Issues discussed today so far were on the Green Deal, High Inflation, High Crime Rates, Fentanyl Surge, Gun Laws, and Illegal Immigrants. Did the biden-harris inflation act so far really reduce inflation? A reduction in the rate of increase in inflation is not a net reduction; going up 20 and down 9 is not an 11% decrease. Trump responds that: &amp;quot;She doesn&amp;#x27;t have a plan. She copied Biden&amp;#x27;s plan and it&amp;#x27;s like 4 sentences: run spot run&amp;quot; - A book on the Ethics of Keeping Pets. It&amp;#x27;s basically Kamala&amp;#x27;s Run Spot Run VS Trump&amp;#x27;s Drill Baby Drill - Oil actually went negative during Trump&amp;#x27;s presidency LOL. Unfortunately, I believe both the Harris and Trump plans will only continue federal deficits and make the current inflation problem worse. My 2 cents is that it&amp;#x27;s frankly too late to turn around.</content>

      <content>In other news, $USDJPY continues to unwind like I said. This continues BoJ Ueda&amp;#x27;s move to strengthen the Yen while the US moves towards the FED Pivot of lowering Interest Rates. $USDJPY just broke 142 for the first time in 2024. The next support is around 125-122, a 25% drop from the June high. This will result in significant pressure to unwind the yen carry trade. I see long treasuries $TLT ripping further up as the dollar hegemony falls. We just broke past 100 yesterday. Also have to watch oil as I just said, making a similar move down on $WTI. They&amp;#x27;re finally talking about Oil and Fracking during the Presidential News debate.</content>

      <content>As for $BTC $QQQ $CVNA I still think we&amp;#x27;re bearish for rest of September. I closed my $BTC short from 64. 9k at 54. 2-55. 2k as stated and re-shorted at 57. 8k so far earlier this morning during the presidential debate. No change in plans. $XAU $TLT still moving up as well. Moves are as expected. Still holding the biases on my positions. TP will be in October likely after FOMC and the Triple Witching.</content>

This comes along with the recent Assassination Attempt by Pro-Ukraine Activist, Ryan Routh at the Florida golf course. This comes along with very big volatility red folder days with the FOMC on Wednesday and Triple Witching (Options Kill Zone) into the Weekend.

      <content>Think $TLT moves first then $XAU and finally $BTC as per this trend. As above I am holding my $TLT to 120+ as we cut interest rates to the 400 basis points &amp;#x27;neutral&amp;#x27; rate. My thesis is that $BTC will face headwinds and a temporary pullback first along with equities into the FOMC Rate Cuts 18th September, with CZ leaving jail 19th September and Triple Witching for Options on 20th September, along with the Yen-Greenback Carry Trade further unwinding. I did say to run $XAU from 2479 here to 2620+, I have also targeted 60. 5k for the $BTC highs to re-short in my private channel above^ (image). I will remain cautious till September is over. Too much red folder days and volatility markers are flaring. Same positions still but I am doing some minor hedging to delta/gamma neutrality with options.</content>

      <content>How I am trading the FOMCI am choosing to go slightly negative delta and still bearish into the FOMC because conventionally I have said rate cuts are bearish. There&amp;#x27;s paltry breadth &amp;amp; volume with an implied move of 1. 2% in either direction. . . highest since the March 2023 regional bank crisis. (Image 1 shown). 3 reasons. (1) The markets in the past cycles have TOPPED into rate cuts(2) This normally comes with big names doing stock splits (remember $TSLA 2022, $AAPL 2020, etc)(3) Yield Curve Un-inversion Steepening, USD JPY Carry Trade Unwinding, Weakest 2 weeks of SeasonalityCould it be that easy?I have no clue for certain what they will do (50 Basis Points looks to be the majority consensus on CME Fed Watch at 63%) (Image 2 shown). I have switched my short positions on $QQQ to a safer 2-3 months DTE bear spread here.

      <content>Tomorrow is another big volatility day: Triple-Witching event is tomorrow, Friday. Search it up if you don‚Äôt know what it is. It happens quarterly and whipsaws the market. This time though, it will be $5 Trillion worth of US options that will expire and disappear as traders roll their positions or enter new ones. Generally for FED FOMC Decisions, this is the play bookDay 1 is the overreaction. (Yesterday)Day 2 is the reaction to Day 1 (Today)Day 3 we find out what the market really thinks about the Fed decision. What I am expecting tomorrow? $SPY 564 to 566 would not surprise me on the Open tomorrow. It may pump after that, or it may trade flat until 9/23 then pump going into 10/4 JOBS REPORT. Although there&amp;#x27;s really not much upside. Additional, we have the SPX Re-balancing After-hours on 9/20. Easier to not trade these last 2 weeks of September and stay flat/low leveraged/defensive like I said.</content>

      <content>FOMC Post-Mortem AnalysisMarkets are set to open today lower, with $SPY looking to open near 566 like I mentioned yesterday ^ to retrace the large gap up (currently at 567 mark price from yesterday&amp;#x27;s 570. 91 close). Just earlier today, we had the Bank of Japan Interest Rate Decision at 12pm GMT +8, 20th September 2024, following directly after the US - Ueda decided to hold its policy rate steady instead of hiking rates, allowing inflation in Japan to continue to tick up. I believe this allows the carry trade to continue with Japan offering a lifeline to the US. I think this decision will allow the cogs to keep going for a couple more weeks but I still see a decent-sized correction before the EOY Santa Claus Rally. I write about my thoughts in-depth in my first newsletter here along with my concerns from the FOMC 50 Basis Points Cut, Yield Curve, Carry Trade, and Recession Risk.

      <content>Asians got the gold bug üíõChina‚Äôs US Treasury holdings have declined by 30% &amp;amp; still buying Gold on record levels. I can only believe this is a long-term move to attempt to disrupt the US reserve currency hegemony by backing the future BRICs currency with collateral. I will be TP-ing my $XAU Gold from 2471 and looking for re-longs into further highs (Have attached my TP Zones - image attached). Similar for $XAG silver. Bonds, commodities and gold today are starting to signal risk off conditions. I&amp;#x27;ve written in my newsletter a read regarding the next possible heavy volatility day on October 9th, 2024. Why is Oct 9, 2024 important? It&amp;#x27;s the day the FED releases the minutes from this week&amp;#x27;s rate cut meeting. (Minutes are released 3 weeks from the meeting). My view seems to be contrarian to what most gurus are saying but doesn&amp;#x27;t hurt to be cautious here.</content>

      <content>China finally starting a Bull Market?We‚Äôre seeing a big up move today in the HK China Markets during Asian hours; if you recall I did say to hedge the markets and I am still in my China, Long Duration Bonds, Gold &amp;amp; Silver which are still trending up since I made the call here at the August Lows. Look at how well $MLCO, $NIO performs today. Unlike other pages, I have been reiterating to buy China at supports these last few months consistently. I am still on the stance that the US rate cuts are bearish for US equities. We are still bullish on momentum for China, Gold, Silver, Bonds - Bitcoin will also follow suit but will have a lag effect and face some headwinds due to more of its global exposure. If you‚Äôre asking what I think moves up next? My best guess would be oil $USO along with shipping, materials in a few months. Thesis for each:China $HSI: breaking out a multi-year resistance trend line with confluence in fundamental changes by the PBOC (People&amp;#x27;s Bank of China). Gold $XAU: Japan and China, dumping US treasuries and bonds with the carry trade further unwinding while bolstering increases in gold reserves. Silver $XAG: Cup and Handle convincingly broke out and Gold to Silver Ratio still shows that its yet to make its big move. Long Duration US Bonds $TLT: A cut in Interest Rates directly causes bond prices to go up, with long durations more related. As the FEDs tend to do multiple rate cuts and with this larger 50 BPS first cut already unprecedented, it shows some stressors in the US economy.

      <content>Silver $XAG on a rocketship now to 32. I have shifted my TPs for both $XAU $XAG Gold and Silver to 2678 and 32. 9. I last entered these at 2479 and 26. 9 respectively. I think Precious Metals are also signalling a recession. We can see from the Dollar weakness today it&amp;#x27;s falling even relative to the Yuan $USDCNY despite the PBoC&amp;#x27;s Stimulus. It&amp;#x27;s a race to the bottom as countries outbid to devalue their currency to maintain trade competitiveness, hegemony and foreign trade reserves. Really sad for the less fortunate people who have no assets or aren&amp;#x27;t financially educated. Inflation is in a nasty course.</content>

      <content>Let‚Äôs talk Inflation: US Dollar on Life SupportWe all know rate cuts imply that the FEDs are printing - why are they doing this? Aside from trade competitiveness, maintaining hegemony and foreign trade reserves. They also need to devalue their ballooning 35 trillion debt; at the point where 30% of all govt revenue goes to paying off the $100 billion per month just in INTEREST payments on the debt. This is why the debt cannot be covered unless forgiven or inflated, less so far as to cut essential social services, etc. Under Biden-Kamala‚Äôs regime, we can see they are simply doing this by devaluing the dollar, and letting assets inflate, hoping the milkshake theory holds, and position into elections (November 5th). Hence equities, commodities, crypto, everything is rallying - essentially back in the roaring 20s just a century later (Off topic: but watch the Great Gatsby, it has a great segment on this üòÄ)We‚Äôre at 100. 281 on the $DXY today. This is reaching a very key point of control and high volume node established in 2015 -2019. I am expect some relief here and a pullback, but the real move like I said should take place around October 9th 2024 for reasons I established earlier in my newsletter. I am Bipartisan, in that, I don‚Äôt care for any of the policies Democrats or Republicans make, I am not a US Citizen, I only care about the economy. Same goes with China, I am not a fan of communism, but I like the stock prices, if you search $KWEB $BABA $NIO in this chat; I have been screaming to buy at lows at 24, 71, 3. 8 respectively - I was even at one point 40k down on my 300k exposure to China. Is it too late here? I don‚Äôt think so. I know cheap PE when I see cheap PE. As for Oil $WTI $USO, I think this move comes a few months later. If Trump wins, I am quite bullish on Oil personally due to his deregulation pro-energy policies.</content>

      <content>Refer to my replied message here on update on positions ^^:Still looking at $SPY to 590-605 for the final tap in resistance and $NIO to a double up from my entry at 3. 83, $MLCO from 5. 10, and $KWEB from 24-25. All performing extremely well. I have taken profit on my $XAU longs like I said from 2471 at 2678 fully today. We have Powell speaking 10 minutes before Market open today, along with Yellen and 6 other Fed speakers. Unemployment Claims today shows the Economy is strong, and actually DID NOT necessitate the 50 BPS initial rate cut, which leads me to suspect that this was a desperation move by the FEDs, possibly covering up a recession, along with their approval in extending government funding today.</content>

      <content>I got 5/7 right for these positions^, essentially most of the longs. Been difficult to time the top. I thankfully opted to switch my shorts to calendar spreads so I am close to delta neutral as long as we don&amp;#x27;t break key regions like 610 on $SPY and 525 on $QQQ. Positional trading so expirations are at least 3 months. Still on the belief rate cuts are bearish and you should research October 2007 Price Action after the September FOMC if you want to know why.</content>

      <content>$NIO and $MLCO I bought from 3. 83 and $5. 20 (Above^) at $6 &amp;amp; $7. 50 today. Came into these for a double-up like I said and just about got it. . üêâI rarely give financial opinions here but I am selling calls on these very slightly OTM for split strikes on a 1-3 month expiration, I am happy to be assigned at these prices. ü§ó Worried on headwinds if we get a Middle East War or Ukraine tensions. Like I said, these are speculative bets and NOT YET profitable, so I&amp;#x27;ll rotate exposure into the more profitable diversified $HSI or $SSI. I took profits on $XAU CFD longs today finally as well. I still see upside but these are my levered positions and I don&amp;#x27;t want to incur prolonged swap/funding fees.</content>

      <content>Have exited full on $XAU Gold and $XAG Silver just like I said above, ate the whole move perfectly. I have also sold covered calls on China positions yesterday and today. Sharing my resistance zones just once here^. Essentially, if I get assigned on my calls, I am going to double up from all my China levered entries. Chose these based on IV/ATR and implied move over 1-2 months DTE.

      <content>Market Close Friday Wrap-upUS Equities Market closed red today with the USDJPY carry trade showing signs of unwinding further. Nikkei gapping down 5%. My last very big trade was in July from $QQQ 505 to 438 and then I repositioned into more China longs at the bottom there, entering $KWEB $BABA $NIO. (Refer to replied post^) on China running-up only at the late stage of the year - still has upside but it needs to refuel and consolidate here. I believe that Oil $USO $WTI and Long Bonds $TLT will make the next move up, with Gold $XAU $BTC retracing mildly with equities, and not act as a safe haven asset in the interim, rising later with $SLV making the largest move in December I said here. Although $SPY is at ATH, I want to stress the weakening majors that are carrying the indice.</content>

      <content>Update on Positions:$NIO has hit my full target of $7. 50 today in the Asian hours open since my entry at 3. 83 here! That is a full double up from my entry along with most of my other Chinese shares hitting TP zones. I will likely be forced to sell my shares at 7. 50 like I mentioned in this screenshot. My targets for $TLT I bought at 89 is about $120, $KWEB from 25 targeting 38-39, $MLCO still holding. Also bearish neutral on US equities/Crypto since 2 weeks ago during FOMC I updated. My gold $XAU from 1800 where I re-longed supports and targeted 2678 is also closed. I am looking at $USO $WTI next. Same for $XAG at 24 to 32. 9. Will do a full review soon!</content>

      <content>US Economy is NOT doing well. . . Mr Powell I don&amp;#x27;t feel so good. . more rate cuts please ü•∫ The long contraction continues for the Chicago PMI, coming in today at 46. 6 in September versus 46. 1 in August and 45. 3 in July. This is its 10th sub-50 reading in a row and the 24th of the last 25 months. It has been stuck in a range of 45. 3 to 47. 4 for the last four months. The headline PMI is a number from 0 to 100. A PMI above 50 represents an expansion when compared with the previous month. A PMI reading under 50 represents a contraction while a reading at 50 indicates no change. ISM last month already showed weakness as I wrote in the last week&amp;#x27;s newsletter below!Source: Is the booming stock market representative that the economy is doing well?</content>

      <content>Middle East war‚Äî Oil up before GTA6 üß¥Markets are set to close red ü©∏ on October 2nd as tensions escalate in the Middle East. I‚Äôve been steadily building my oil position, believing it‚Äôs been significantly suppressed. Sure, I do occasionally get trades wrong‚Äîoil even went negative in 2020, and I remember Trump boasting about it on TV, justifying bailouts for the oil industry. But my core thesis remains that oil has historically surged during periods of conflict, from the 1973 Embargo to the 1990 Gulf War, and most recently, the 2022 Russia-Ukraine war. üí£Looking ahead, with the Biden/Harris administration nearing its end, let‚Äôs not forget they‚Äôve drained the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to its lowest level in 40 years (attached image). The silver lining is that they plan to, and WILL LIKELY, buy it back at these levels below $70, spurring demand. $WTI $USO üõ¢ Full write-up/video analysis dropping tomorrow!</content>

      <content>What Oil is telling us about the Middle East War  1.  Port strikes negatively impact GDP and inflation.  2.  Escalation in the Middle East drives oil prices higher, which is detrimental to inflation.  3.  We are undergoing one of the largest tightening phases in history, harming GDP.  4.  Economic stimulus from China raises commodity prices, with the overcrowded trade short China funds getting margin called.  5.  The US face a significant public debt bubble, high valuations, and limited profit growth potential. Biden is depleting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to its lowest levels in decades to artificially lower gas prices. He promised to replenish the SPR when oil hit around $70 per barrel; however, after WTI dropped to $67. 70 on September 2, he has not made any purchases. As of October 1, 2024, the US has ONLY JUST started purchasing 6 million barrels for the SPR, with deliveries scheduled through May 2025, according to the Department of Energy. Still, they need to allocate funds from the $110 billion sent to Ukraine. If the Harris Administration hadn‚Äôt relaxed Iranion oil sanctions to obtain oil for the SPR, (they allowed Iran to export their Oil, at the same time funding the Middle East Conflict) they wouldn‚Äôt have been able to engage in this Middle East conflict.

      <content>NFP Non-farm Employment came out actual 254k, over 147k. I closed my shorts of $BTC from 64. 9k at 60. 3k and and $QQQ from $494 at 479. 8 yesterday. Have re-positioned into the open today. I said this on twitter as well; this move will be faded to trap longs. On the longer-term macro, US equities are STILL overbought. I have stood by my China bullish thesis throughout the year and I will stand by my US neutral-bearish positions now. Good jobs data generally implies slower rate cuts, with markets pricing in less 2024 rate cuts! Cheers!ü•Ç</content>

      <content>$NIO, $KWEB, and $BABA are down over 10% during the Asian market open, with $NIO currently at 6. 32, $KWEB at 34, and $BABA at 109. As I mentioned earlier, I‚Äôve closed and hedged all of my Chinese positions at resistance levels, outright selling leveraged positions and placing covered calls on long-term holdings‚Äîtiming it perfectly at the top. Knowing when to realise gains is equally important!The correction in long bonds (like $TLT, 20Y, and 10Y) is a clear sign that the market doesn‚Äôt believe we‚Äôll see 50 bps rate cuts in the upcoming November/December FOMC meetings. It reflects slowing rate cut expectations despite the FED‚Äôs more aggressive rhetoric, also causing the yield curve to go into negative territory again. I believe this is because they‚Äôre still propping up the stock market ahead of the US elections, which are just about a month away. However, in this latest YouTube video, I explore the possibility of a black swan event, with the middle east conflict still escalating.</content>

Continued US rate cuts now seem even less likely with bond markets calling the FEDs dovish bluff with the dollar showing strength!We have $MCD shares crashing 10% after hours yesterday with CDC links to an E Coli update and $TSLA making a move up today after hours beating all estimates for earnings except a revenue miss and bouncing nicely off the support trendline. This will provide some temporary relief to $SPY $QQQ equity indices. However, sell volume was 35% higher than Tues indicating increasing bearish concerns. $TSLA bounce after earnings will not have a big effect longer term (was $260 earlier this month). Will be selling puts in China for $BIDU $NIO here for a 3-6 months expiration.</content>

      <content>McDonald‚Äôs: Property or Burgers? Ever heard McDonald‚Äôs is more in real estate than burgers? üè°&amp;gt;üçî? There‚Äôs truth to it! Here‚Äôs why: when you buy a Big Mac, most of that profit goes to the local franchise owner, not McDonald‚Äôs üçü. Unlike Starbucks ‚òïÔ∏è, where sales revenue flows straight to HQ, McDonald‚Äôs franchises 95% of its locations, collecting rent and royalties from franchisees. This model means McDonald‚Äôs profits from real estate, not just food, while ensuring quality control. They approve, train, and oversee franchises and innovate on products for consistency worldwide.

In light of this correction, Prime Minister Modi has been urging retail investors to increase their market participation, urging Indians to invest 50% of their savings into the stock market, despite being the most overvalued stock market in the world based on PE ratio (yes, more overvalued than the US), despite the prevailing risks.

      <content>üìà Stocks to Watch in a Trump Victory Scenario! üìâAs election season heats up, certain stocks are showing potential gains on a Trump win. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of stocks and assets to consider:1Ô∏è‚É£ $GEO (GEO Group) - Up 150% since midterms, GEO operates for-profit detention centers and could gain from Trump‚Äôs tough stance on immigration policies, similar to 2016. 2Ô∏è‚É£ $DJT (Trump Media &amp;amp; Tech) - At $21. 45, Trump‚Äôs recent rallies boost investor sentiment. But expect volatility, with some aiming to ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news‚Äù around election day. 3Ô∏è‚É£ $TSLA (Tesla) - Trading at $236. 94, Tesla benefits from the Trump-Musk alignment on pro-business policies, though green initiatives may vary. 4Ô∏è‚É£ $RUM (Rumble) - At $9. 12, Rumble stands to gain from Trump‚Äôs anti-woke, free-speech audience, positioning itself as an alternative media platform. With a series of high-profile gaffes from Kamala Harris, Trump‚Äôs odds have surged to 67% on Polymarket heading into the final week! ü§Øüá∫üá∏ Sign up on XM to trade the US election!Source: Stocks to look out for in the event of a Trump Victory</content>

      <content>Volatility spikes with Elections &amp;amp; November FOMC 1 week awayüìâ Wall Street slumped Thursday as Microsoft (-5. 1%) &amp;amp; Meta (-2. 8%) warned of higher AI costs despite strong earnings, cooling tech enthusiasm. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed above 4. 3%, adding pressure, while inflation data showed core PCE up 2. 7%‚Äîa slight beat, fueling Fed concerns over rate cuts. üìäInvestor focus shifted to AI‚Äôs profitability timeline, with ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù stocks hit hard: Nvidia (-2. 8%), Amazon (-1. 7%), &amp;amp; Apple (-0. 4%). The Dow fell 184 points (-0. 44%), the S&amp;amp;P 500 dropped 0. 86%, &amp;amp; Nasdaq slipped 1. 4%. Meanwhile, energy rose 1% thanks to strong ConocoPhillips results. ‚ö°Ô∏èAs traders await Friday‚Äôs job data &amp;amp; brace for Fed‚Äôs November meeting, the S&amp;amp;P 500 turned negative for October, &amp;amp; the VIX hit a 3-week high, signaling further volatility ahead. I am still holding the belief that US equities will pullback further into and after the elections. With it being a &amp;quot;sell the news&amp;quot; event. I think this will ripple into global markets as well, with China facing regulatory headwinds, and India continuing it&amp;#x27;s current pullback. As of now, my main play is to still accumulate the dropping oil $USO and hold onto my precious metals $GLD $XAU. I will look into diversifying into miners $VALE $NUGT in a few weeks.

      <content>How to Analyse Financial Ratios üìàEver wondered which stocks are ‚Äúcheap‚Äù or which countries offer value for money? Financial ratios help gauge market valuation, but they don‚Äôt tell the whole story, especially if the Federal Reserve is printing money. It‚Äôs crucial to look deeper into specific sectors. Ranking (Most Expensive to Least Expensive): 1. United States (P/E: 26. 01) 2. India (P/E: 25. 75) 3. Singapore (P/E: 12. 13) 4. China (P/E: 9. 36)Understanding Basic Financial Ratios:P/E ratio is calculated as Current Market Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS). A high P/E signals growth expectations but may indicate overvaluation. Forward P/E considers projected earnings, providing insights into future growth. Markets with lower P/Es, like China and Singapore, may be undervalued, while the U. S. and India remain at premium levels.

      <content>China Position UpdatesI‚Äôm back into 30% of China positions here! Still hoping the elections push price down further so I can buy further discounted assets! I am bullish China already for 2025. I‚Äôve sold long-dated cash-secured puts during the recent pullback. Re-entered partially $NIO at 5. 10-5. 30, $BIDU at $92, and $KWEB at $32-33. I believe $NIO and $BIDU have retraced the most and offer significant upside compared to US companies like $CLOV and $CVNA, which are pricing higher despite poor fundamentals. The election is peripheral for Chinese stocks; as my purchases are offshore ADRs, and both Democrat &amp;amp; Republican parties show antagonism towards China.</content>

      <content>FED continues Rate Cuts in Nov FOMCFed Chairman Jerome Powell says he won‚Äôt resign even if Donald Trump demands it. Here‚Äôs something many don‚Äôt know: The Fed isn‚Äôt actually part of the government. Unelected officials are controlling your money and fueling inflation. If the Fed were a private company, both it and Chair Powell would have been ousted long ago. Remember, they called inflation ‚Äútransitory‚Äù in late ‚Äô21, only to kick off the steepest rate hike cycle in 40 years in March ‚Äô22. The U. S. Federal Reserve cut rates yesterday by 0. 25%, citing a ‚Äúgenerally eased‚Äù job market and inflation nearing its 2% target. Powell noted that future cuts will depend on economic data, with a goal of maintaining balanced growth. As Trump returns, the Fed‚Äôs policy may face new political pressures with major economic implications. Source: End the FED</content>

      <content>I believe Trump&amp;#x27;s wins and the continued FED rate cuts will remain to prop the market up, and we remain bullish till the end of year. However, I personally will not heavily invest in the US equities market (especially tech) due to my personal disdain towards their high valuations. I am still in my China positions and only in consumer discretionary (recently into $NKE) again. If you‚Äôre expecting a bigger pullback on the US Market, I think this still comes‚Ä¶ but closer to when we‚Äôre under the neutral Fed Funds rate of 4% (We‚Äôre currently at 4. 75% as of yesterday‚Äôs FOMC cut). Generally going under the neutral rate is when the FEDs are panicking over a crisis. Crypto $BTC is very bullish on the monthly now especially with Trump‚Äôs statement on creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (similar to Petroleum) so I won‚Äôt be shorting this.</content>

      <content>The Bond Market is calling the FEDs bluff and suggesting Interest Rates to remain Higher for Longer!The US 10-Year Yield has sharply rebounded from 3. 6% in September to 4. 5% in November 2024, returning to levels last seen in June. This underscores a tightening cycle, where long-term yields lag, signaling potential cracks in the Fed‚Äôs policy outlook. It also reflects lingering concerns about a second wave of inflation and prolonged higher interest rates. Given this, the December FOMC meeting may result in a pause (at 4. 75%) rather than continued easing to neutral rates (FFR 4%). It also suggests the yield curve will remain inverted longer. If the yield curve uninverts and short-term borrowing costs drop, it would signal the Fed‚Äôs intervention to prevent a market crash. TLDR; Heavy cuts could be bearish, hinting that the Fed might know something we don‚Äôt. For now, it seems we‚Äôre pausing and slowing rate cuts, with clear skies ahead.</content>

      <content>Oil Prices Hit Two-Week Highs üõ¢Ô∏èOnce again, geopolitical tensions involving Russia and Iran are sparking fears of supply disruptions, while robust crude demand from China and India adds fuel to the oil price demands, rallying 6% last week. I believe if economic data weakens and $TLT bottoms, this would signal economic decline, likely leading to reduced oil demand while supply increases. TLDR; While Tensions are Bullish Oil, Worsening economic data could spoil this momentum. Source: Oil holding lows. . . for now</content>

But is this sustainable? ü§îDespite its eye-popping rally and massive $136B weekly trading volume (beating even $GME‚Äôs meme-stock days), MicroStrategy‚Äôs core business has been in decline for over a decade.

      <content>How much will Bitcoin drop? üìâ In the last cycles, Bitcoin was more correlated with equities as a risk-on asset. Instead, $BTC this last year has tracked the world&amp;#x27;s M2 money supply perfectly, roughly with a 10-week delay. Over the past year, it has behaved more like commodities such as gold, with holding companies like $MSTR stocking Bitcoin. Barring any major war/calamity. . .

      <content>G7 Manipulating Canadian Dollar?The Canadian dollar (CAD) has slumped to its lowest levels since April 2020, down 6% this year, driven by a rising unemployment rate (6. 8% as of November), weakening economic indicators, and expectations of a 50-basis-point rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC) on December 11. I believe that concurrently, the G7 economies are artificially weakening the CAD to push oil prices down, at the cost of Canadian&amp;#x27;s oil-export-driven economy.

      <content>9 Consecutive Sessions of Losses for Dow JonesFunny how the Dow Jones has 9 straight days of losses yet the media barely covers it and sweeps this news under the carpet. Could this be a market euphoria stage? Additionally, as the Fed is expected to make a 3rd consecutive rate cut this week, many experts are also bracing for a slower pace of cuts in 2025. This is in light of the nation&amp;#x27;s still-sticky inflation rate and some of President-elect Donald Trump&amp;#x27;s proposed economic policies, which, if enacted, could prove inflationary.

      <content>What‚Äôs Next for FOMC Rates?With the Federal Reserve‚Äôs meeting minutes set to be released on Wednesday (8/1/2025), the central bank continues to tread carefully as it balances efforts to control inflation with the need to protect the labor market. Inflation remains above the 2% target, while unemployment holds steady at 4. 2%. As economic data (jobs/inflation) improve, bond and currency markets suggest rate cuts may slow, with the dollar rallying and risk assets seeing a mild pullback. I anticipate a continuation of 25 BPS in the next meeting as they cut toward neutral FFR, accompanied by hawkish guidance emphasizing that the fight against inflation is far from over. This is reflected in the current bond market, with short-term rates rising while long-term yields fall, signaling near-term hawkishness and caution about future growth.

      <content>2025 Outlook on AsiaQuite a loaded article on a few Asian markets. Geopolitical risks, global supply chain disruptions, and potential tightening monetary policies from major central banks like the US Federal Reserve will likely add pressure on these markets. I believe $NIFTY50, $TAIEX and $SPY are quite frothy especially $SPY with sitting at around PE of 27. However, the markets could continue its frothy growth for the short term, buoyed by liquidity and continued innovation in sectors like AI, cloud computing, and electric vehicles. Personally, I wouldn&amp;#x27;t buy in at these levels due to limited upside reward with significant downside risks. To each their own!Source: Asia&amp;#x27;s Economic Outlook 2025: Stocks &amp;amp; Sectors</content>

      <content>Distinct Head and Shoulders pattern, which is a bearish pattern formed at the top of a market rally or local high. All those who kept yapping about Winter Rally are now silent. The move up during end December did not make another all time high and MACD indicates bearish signal of loss of momentum. On the weekly, MACD line has crossed below the MACD signal line, indicating medium term bearishness. Purely textbook technical analysis standpoint, so we gotta see how price goes at neckline.</content>

S. jobs report, leading investors to question if rates will drop at all this year. This is also after last week&amp;#x27;s FOMC Meeting Minutes that signaled a more restrictive monetary policy and slower rate cuts. The bond market and FED dot plots are already telling U. S. Treasury yields are going to climb higher. I expect further weakness in risk assets üìâ all the way till March 2025. - Diverging Yields: U. S. Treasury yields soar past 5%, while China‚Äôs 10-year yields drop below 1. 6% for the first time ever. - China‚Äôs Weak Economy: Falling yields highlight weaker growth expectations as China‚Äôs stimulus continues to underwhelm. - Ripple Effects: A sluggish Chinese economy spells trouble for giants like Apple and Tesla, heavily reliant on Chinese demand. - USD Bond Play: China‚Äôs move to issue bonds in USD could challenge the dollar‚Äôs dominance.

      <content>1. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) RatioCompanion Variable: Expected Growth Rate in Earnings Per Share (EPS).

Interpretation: The market may not be fully pricing in the company‚Äôs growth potential. 2. Price-to-Book Value (P/BV) RatioCompanion Variable: Return on Equity (ROE). Mismatch Indicator:A low P/BV ratio with a high ROE indicates undervaluation. Interpretation: The company is efficient in generating profits from equity, but the market isn‚Äôt reflecting this in its valuation. 3. Price-to-Sales (P/S) RatioCompanion Variable: Net Profit Margin. Mismatch Indicator:A low P/S ratio with a high net profit margin suggests the company is undervalued. Interpretation: Despite strong profitability from sales, the company‚Äôs valuation appears low. 4. Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)Companion Variable: Reinvestment Rate. Mismatch Indicator:A low EV/EBITDA ratio with low reinvestment needs signals undervaluation. Interpretation: The company generates strong earnings with minimal reinvestment, indicating high free cash flow potential. 5. Enterprise Value-to-Capital (EV/Capital)Companion Variable: Return on Capital (ROC). Mismatch Indicator:A low EV/Capital ratio with a high return on capital indicates undervaluation. Interpretation: The company effectively generates high returns on invested capital but is priced cheaply by the market. 6. Enterprise Value-to-Sales (EV/Sales)Companion Variable: After-Tax Operating Margin. Mismatch Indicator:A low EV/Sales ratio with a high after-tax operating margin suggests undervaluation.

      <content>What Happened on Inauguration | $TRUMP and $MELANIA TokensThe $TRUMP meme token launched just two days before the inauguration, sparking debates about its timing. üá∫üá∏It briefly flipped Layer 1 $SUI, hitting $15 billion market cap within 48 hours!Meanwhile, $MELANIA (his wife) is down 70% from its peak in just 2 days. Why Meme Coins Are Risky:‚ö†Ô∏è Fake Volume: Market makers &amp;amp; wash trading can create false demand on CEXes/DEXes. ‚ö†Ô∏è Fake Rankings: Paid traffic can boost visibility on screeners. ‚ö†Ô∏è Manipulation: Large holders pump prices by delaying sales. Even when it seems like token ownership is ‚Äúdiversified,‚Äù multiple wallets can still belong to a single entity. Some hide this well; others, not so much. For example, the recent Hawk Tuah Girl Token shows concentrated supply among a few wallets. Even if they split tokens across multiple accounts, they could still retain control. You can see insane gains like 1,000%, but those profits are also not guaranteed to be liquid. Just throwing caution to the wind!</content>

      <content>January FOMC Decision Market Analysis/UpdateI still see the top-side target for BTC around $110K‚Äì$120K as previously mentioned. These are not levels to be buying at. While it may sound outlandish, I believe we‚Äôre in for a second inflation spike later this year, forcing the Fed to hike rates again, especially if pressured to match the BoJ‚Äôs tightening stance. Crypto seems to be very tied to M2 Money Supply now. Right now, bond and options markets are only pricing in a 25% chance of this &amp;#x27;rate hike&amp;#x27; scenario. Barclays analysts still expect slightly lower rates in 2025 but aren‚Äôt ruling out hikes. The FOMC decision yesterday was already priced in, and we did see a rally, but taking profits/cash is a good option for now. I expect a small pullback by mid-February before the rally resumes, with a larger correction in Q3/Q4 when rate hikes return.</content>

      <content>U. S. Trade War BeginsWhile the administration asserts that tariffs will not lead to inflation, economists warn of potential economic disruptions, including increased production costs and retaliatory actions from trading partners. Removing tariffs could be politically unpopular for both sides involved, particularly given the current political climate. For the U. S. , lifting tariffs could be seen as a sign of weakness or a retreat from a strong stance on protecting domestic industries and jobs, which is a key part of President Trump&amp;#x27;s policy platform. Implications on different financial assets are mentioned in the article!Updates:U. S. Economy: Tariffs may reduce U. S. economic output by 0. 4% over the next decade, leading to inflation and higher consumer prices. Canada &amp;amp; Mexico: Both countries are retaliating with their own tariffs, targeting key sectors like agriculture, energy, and automotive, disrupting vital North American trade. China: While initially focusing on legal action through the WTO, China faces tariff-induced cost increases in tech, electronics, and textiles. Source: U. S.

      <content>U. S. Market &amp;amp; Trade War UpdateI still believe the U. S. market is overvalued. Trump has followed through on a lot of his plans‚Äîhe‚Äôs already signed away many of Biden‚Äôs deals and imposed tariffs, albeit mostly as threats. I think his austerity measures will eventually pull down the markets, and by Q3-Q4, we‚Äôll likely see him offset fiscal tightening with monetary easing, something he&amp;#x27;s already pushing for. This move could push markets back up in the short term, but I expect the overall impact to be negative. Tariffs on Mexico PausedU. S. tariffs on Mexico are NOW paused for a month. In exchange, Mexico will deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to the border to curb illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking. Trump confirmed the deal but did not mention efforts to stop weapons trafficking.</content>

      <content>$NIO PredictionEarnings date: 03/05/2025Bull Case (Leaning towards this):Given deliveries (known at 72,689) and stimulus tailwinds, NIO likely beats revenue at $2. 9-$3 billion. Margins improve to 11%-12% due to alloy savings, yielding -$0. 30 EPS. The stock‚Äôs lack of pre-earnings run-up suggests a 20%-30% pop to $5. 10-$5. 50 if guidance excites (e. g. , 440,000 units for 2025, Firefly/ET9 traction). Post-earnings, $5. 50-$6 by April 2025 is feasible if macro holds. Bear Case:If price wars hit harder than expected, Q4 revenue undershoots at $2. 7 billion (below $2. 8B consensus), with margins slipping to 9% due to ONVO‚Äôs low ASPs and discounting, resulting in -$0. 45 EPS. Guidance disappoints at 380,000 units for 2025 with profitability pushed beyond Q4 2025. The stock drops 10%-15% to $3. 80-$3. 60, with tariff fears and a Hang Seng pullback capping recovery; a slide to $3 or below is possible by April 2025 if sentiment sours further.</content>

      <content>Where I see markets headed:Dollar Devaluation: I expect the dollar to weaken without Fed rate hikes or cuts, preserving the current 4. 25-4. 5% range. This stasis aids devaluing the $36T debt, reducing its real burden. Musk &amp;amp; DOGE: Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE will likely enforce austerity, slashing $2T from spending. This curbs deficits, creating space for future rate cuts if needed. Monetary Policy: I foresee a continued pause on rate cuts in 2025, but backdoor QE will emerge‚Äîdraining the Reverse Repo ($350B) and Treasury General Account ($700B). These moves inject liquidity, support markets, and subtly weaken the dollar. Market Outlook: I think Bonds have bottomed, unless Japan and China continues to unwind positions to bolster purchasing of gold. Silver will start creeping up, running up on the lag on gold as well. Crypto still has another leg up. US Equities as well but not before a pullback. However, imo 2nd half of the year feels dicey, primed for a larger correction.

      <content>ByBit just hacked for potentially 1. 3 Billion in EthereumBybit confirmed a sophisticated attack on Feb 21, 2025, targeting an ETH multisig cold wallet during a transfer to a warm wallet. The signing interface was spoofed, hiding altered smart contract logic that redirected funds to an unknown address.  A digital asset security platform might have prevented this. Solutions like Fireblocks use Multi-Party Computation (MPC), replacing multisig‚Äôs on-chain vulnerabilities with off-chain signing and air-gapped cold storage, BitGo‚Äôs multisig with cold storage, Anchorage‚Äôs HSM-backed custody, and Copper‚Äôs MPC-hybrid also bolster security could have fixed this. Just some shoddy security overall‚Ä¶ Bybit‚Äôs setup likely lacked these, exposing a single point of failure.  Exact losses (rumoured $1. 4B) are unclear, but the breach underscores a need for layered defenses beyond basic multisig. This is looking bearish on Crypto, given the falling US equities and Bond Markets pricing in some end February weakness on risk assets as well. Source: ByBit confirms Eth Hack</content>

      <content>3 key signs we hit a local market top:We&amp;#x27;ve seen this every cycle. 1. ByBit hack drained massive liquidity (Black Swan Event)2. Coinbase topping App Store rankings (On Dec 2017 too)3. FTX funds returning adds exit liquidity (Remember Mt Gox?) Now, I see $BTC nearing a local bottom at 75-79 and $ETH at 1700-1900 (levels I called earlier) on both chats and Youtube. This drop worsened by Trump‚Äôs trade war, especially the new EU clash 2 hours ago. To push protectionism and control the debt/spending, he‚Äôll promote austerity with DOGE, devalue the dollar and keep foreign taxes high ‚Äî still bullish for $TLT.</content>

This will be in line with my $QQQ target (3) For $QQQ - still holding entirety of positional shorts from 538, looking for 485-495, but I am selling puts to move to delta neutrality in the short-term. (4) $TLT is purely a spot position play (have 200k riding on this, I have disclosed before)May not be exactly right with my bottom target as it depends on liquidation levels, so I would just ladder and watch Price Action. I am still holding my Gold, Silver and China, with the latter being the highest weightage. My $BABA sold calls at 155 strike for 3 months are still active. Still bullish on commodities, and China. Particularly watching $USO $WTI now. Just trying to organically grow this channel (which is finally growing). Will do a referral program soon!

      <content>Trump&amp;#x27;s Additional Tariffs Trump‚Äôs latest 10% tariff on China, effective March 4, escalates the trade war, risking global economic fallout. I believe Trump is using this as a negotiation tactic rather than starting an economic war because it&amp;#x27;s a lose lose for all. China&amp;#x27;s diversification of its exports and massive trade surplus may lessen the bite of tariffs on its economy. Remember that Trump&amp;#x27;s policies bring short-term pain to the economy and financial markets but are generally healthier long-term! His administration has shown sensitivity to stock market performance, with Trump often touting market gains as a metric of success. Look at how he had to delay the tariffs because markets were initially tanking upon tariff announcements!Source: Trump‚Äôs Tariff Hike: China Trade War Risks and Gains</content>

      <content>Trump&amp;#x27;s Crypto Strategic ReserveTrump announced that he is working on the Crypto Strategic Reserve which will adopt these cryptocurrencies‚ÄîBitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano‚Äîinto its framework. Quite coincidental that there was a selloff along with equities because of tariff fears just to announce it after and pump crypto up again!This can go both ways to be honest. Government endorsement could attract more institutional investors to adopt crypto as a form of investment. If the government decides to sell its holdings in the future, it could flood the market, causing price drops. The reserve could distort market dynamics, creating a moral hazard where investors rely on government intervention (lender of last resort). If equities continue to bleed when market opens then we could see a crypto selloff! Been seeing increased correlation of $QQQ and $BTC. Source: Trump‚Äôs Crypto Reserve Sparks Rally</content>

      <content>Gonna punt a tiny $BTC short soon. Very tiny short ladders at the 2 red regions with 86-87k (30%) and 91. 6-92. 6k (70%). I am not as confident of this short because while it is low volume, we&amp;#x27;ve seen this market rally off low volume and manipulation before. However, I believe the trend is down till at least 72k to potentially 68k where we fully bottom. However, if we do that, it means that that would be the impulse Elliot Wave C and it would mark the end of the cyclical bull market. Not ruling it out.</content>

      <content>$BTC to $70k? Crypto Reserve Faces ObstaclesI think Trump‚Äôs Crypto Reserve is a bold but reckless idea and a flashy political move that ignores the messy reality of getting anything done in a divided government. During his run for presidency, he flipped to support crypto‚Äîdespite being anti-crypto in his first term‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs a rare issue with no divided masses or opposition pressure, unlike rallying a specific group that always sparks pushback. Crypto is wildly volatile which can swing double digits in a day. This makes it a nightmare for stable, long-term planning, unlike traditional reserves like oil or gold. $BTC has bled most of its gains after his announcement of the Crypto Reserve. If this optimism continues to die down we could see it fall further to $70k!Source: Trump‚Äôs Crypto Reserve Faces Red State &amp;amp; Congress Hurdles</content>

The demand for AI might hold for a bit and consumer sales look weak with rising prices! Based on technicals, $NVDA has had a massive run up with no meaningful retracements and established support levels. Any corrections can set the stage for deeper discounts! To those bagholding and are looking to sell into a relief rally, $125-$129 is a strong resistance. NFA and best of lucküëçüèºSource: Nvidia Stock at $110: Bearish Outlook and Analysis</content>

      <content>Retail Buying &amp;amp; Institutional SellingI expect a short-term rebound as the market seeks relief. On the daily timeframe, the price has cut through the 50, 100, and 200-day moving averages, with the 50-day edging lower after signalling the start of a correction. On the weekly chart, price barely touched the 50-day moving average, supporting a case for a relief rally from here!

      <content>Positions Update:We have convincingly broken down below the 200MA across $BTC $QQQ $SPY. If you were on my livestream or joined from there yesterday, I did say I am still in my $BTC shorts from 94k targeting 72k, possibly even extending to 68k - That should align with my $QQQ target of 445-435. If you scroll above you would see that I publicly gave the short from 98k $BTC after the ByBit hack into flipping long at 78k and targeting 94k (sounds ridiculous but I actually prepared for that). Now I am saying prepare for sub 70k, but DO NOT short below 75k. (98k $BTC short targeting 80k close)(80k $BTC long targeting 86k close)(92k $BTC short targeting 72k close) - I gave all the entry and exits way in advance. We are here now. Once again, just my 2 cents - Trying to interpret the market for y&amp;#x27;alls ü§ôüèª Don&amp;#x27;t claim to be the best, but if you&amp;#x27;ve been here long enough you&amp;#x27;d have seen me do this before.</content>

      <content>Actually still the same chart for $BTC ^ (refer to above) targeting 72-74k for closing shorts and a possible wick under 70k (i‚Äôll rely a lot on price action and liquidation data on that day). Same reason why I chose to long at 80k before the 94k the previous time (too many late shorts allowing for a squeeze up). Right now, in my core portfolio, I am still long Bonds and China. Still in my $TLT positions from $87 targeting $110; (doing the Wheels Strategy here)&amp;amp; still in $BABA from $73 - I targeted $145-155 anticipating significant resistance here so I am still selling calls &amp;amp; am close to collecting $12 in premiums which is going to make my average buys for $BABA $61 üòÇ (goal is to make this position $0 cost). I have shared this before as well months back (scroll up). I believe this US equities pullback and Trump&amp;#x27;s Tariffs will present very short-term headwinds for China, but I don&amp;#x27;t believe we&amp;#x27;re pulling back much. Will go on livestream again in a bit.</content>

      <content>Wall Street Dives on Tariff FearsWall Street got absolutely decimated on March 10 as Trump‚Äôs vague tariff plans spooked investors, hinting at a 2025 recession. Tech stocks tanked‚Äîthe Nasdaq plunged 4% to 17,468. 32, with Tesla cratering 15. 4%. Hopes of tax cuts fades as 25% steel tariffs looms on Wednesday.  Are tariff chaos and Musk‚Äôs DOGE Austerity cuts denting confidence the real reason behind this crash? ü©∏ Or were the insane valuations just simply too much? üò§I&amp;#x27;m leaning on the latter; you had to look at companies like Wingstop $WING with a 130 P/E ratio at it&amp;#x27;s peak now back to more modest levels at 67 (still high).

      <content>How China will compete with Trump&amp;#x27;s Tariffs? ü´°üêâHow? By devaluing the Yuan to counter Trump‚Äôs tariffs and keep exports cheap!Trump‚Äôs plan: 10% tariffs on Chinese goods, 25% on Mexico &amp;amp; Canada to block China‚Äôs backdoors. China‚Äôs move to devalue the Yuan softens the tariffs‚Äô impact, but Trump is betting big that taxes on Chinese Goods will force change. I believe the Trade War will develop into a Currency war with Mexico and Canada following suit to devalue against the dollar. What does this mean? Conventionally, a weaker Yuan would boost Chinese Equities. Momentum is still with China - We remain Bullish China üìàüá®üá≥Source: WW3 = Trade War</content>

      <content>3 Hours till the BIG FOMC decision Market expects 99% Probability of NO CUTS üìâ‚ú¶ Let&amp;#x27;s review the data:‚Üí CPI and PPI came in below expectations, big drop in inflation. ‚Üí PCE Index and Real-Time Proxies still show inflation increasing‚Üí Data lags about 45 days, Inflation is now 0. 56pp lower now. Some conflicting uncertain data here - However, here‚Äôs why I BELIEVE we‚Äôll get rate cuts in JUNE 2025. If you recall the last few years, I have been precise with my higher for longer interest rates rhetoric despite others calling for earlier rate cuts. Why have I flipped my stance in Q2 2025I have ruled out the possibility of a second spike in Inflation &amp;amp; a subsequent rate hike - which I presumed last year, conditional on Biden continuing his irresponsible spending. With Trump ü¶Ö, rate hikes are unlikely‚Äîraising them could tank the economy. His admin pushes for lower yields to save the bond market, but tariffs may spark a currency war, with others dumping US bonds to counter his policies.</content>

      <content>FOMC Decision: 50 BPS Rate Cuts Projected for 2025!FOMC‚Äôs March 19, 2025 decision kept rates at 4. 25%-4. 5%, reflecting caution as inflation stays above 2%. Powell pointed to Trump‚Äôs tariffs as a factor in rising üî• inflation expectations, suggesting rate cuts might pause if costs rise. Yet despite this, The Fed still sees 50 bps of cuts in 2025, aiming for 3. 9%. As I said previously above^. The Fed will slow Treasury redemptions to $5B from April, hinting at QE-like moves. Risk assets are already reflecting this shift, $BTC $NQ $EQ $TLT moving upwards üìàI actually think Powell dislikes Trump?? Trump is systematically dismantling the need for the Federal Reserve, making his job useless.

      <content>Are Bonds telling us we are entering a Recession?Is $TLT being stuck at the $80-90 telling us something? üé£In my opinion, current economic data hints at a recession‚Äî with consumer confidence at 98. 3, jobless claims at 242K, GDP at 2. 3%. Earlier last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott¬†Bessent&amp;#x27;s¬†pledge to contain yields on 10-year Treasury notes - getting the long and more sensitive end of the curve lower. These statements caused Yields to fall‚Äî10Y at 4. 308% (19/3/2025), down from 4. 51% last month‚Äîpushed by recession fears and easing term premia (-4. 9bp). Yet Inflation remains low &amp;amp; steady at 2. 6%, presenting a bullish case for $TLT to rise. üî•As you guys know, I‚Äôm Bullish Bonds; With the trade war, slowing inflation and Bessent bent on  I see more short-term currency devaluations &amp;gt; Lower Yields &amp;gt; Higher Bond Prices.
