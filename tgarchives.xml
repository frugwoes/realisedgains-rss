      <content>21th JanLong 37.8 to 38.5 regionStart closing at Resistance- 39.2-39.2 (1st TP) 40% CloseRemainder 60% put with a trailing stop loss as we attempt to run up to the lower probability (2nd TP)- 40.7-40.9 (2nd TP) 40% CloseLast TP for all would be 46/47k and 53/55kTo me (1st TP) is a very high probabilistic play. I am not touching much alts at the moment, but that‚Äôs because considering my size isn‚Äôt small, i will have to deal with too much slippage issues. Will advise differently for smaller portfolios. Alternatively ETH can also be done with this ranges. Will update on Stocks & Commodities later!</content>

      <content>Taking some profits at 39.1 - 39.3 region as I stated. Will teach you guys how to ladder out exits as well. Then change to a trailing stop loss to de-risk. Depending on how you guys like to trade - for me, I honestly only touch my positions once every 1-2 weeks. But during that few hours period I tend to be a little more active (like now) to protect my positions/entries.</content>

      <content>(Crypto) How I am managing this range is basically using my previous profits I took at 39.2 from 38.4 as a buffer for current positions. Still in some longs with a trailing stop loss. Will come up with some Udemy materials and guides soon!

      <content>Like I said on 17th December above, if you are into NFT/Gaming Coins I think they have no value fundamentally. Coins like$DAR,$AXSwill crash very very heavily. These have dropped 60-80% from ATH but BTC is only on a 50% drop. This is the reason I only buy$BTC,$ETH, or L1 coins if I am doing value investing. If you want to buy the dip, buy fundamental stuff. A lot of things will die with this pullback.</content>

      <content>I would say to stay calm at these prices, I don't think we go to 20s, I think we hold here in the 30s for awhile before we get a relief short squeeze back to 37.8k - 38.8k (this might be a chance to exit or take profits), after that bounce we have to reassess if back in a bull market or consider the global situation to see if we enter a recession/hard correction. Funding is negative which is rare for most markets as it's normally a buyers market. Crypto/Stocks movements now actually rely heavily on the Russia Situation, Interest Rate Policies I believe.</content>

      <content>Holding my Crypto Positions, got some$SOL,$FTTon that dip, as well as still in long.$CLOVi am still laddering in, very very slowly around $2.5-$2.6, floor can be deep on this one! My rationale for stocks are to take a much longer swing as opposed to Crypto. Normally for Crypto I am more of a swing trader as I think the markets are much more volatile, you have to get in and out fast. For Stocks, I can normally do 3-5 months even to let my idea play out.</content>

      <content>if this doesn't hold, it could just range within this region, which is also something i'm expecting. but in general this is a very speculative style of trading doing daily candles. if you're doing a wider swing play lets say weekly/monthly, i think buying here for a longer term hold for a more chill, wider region play isn't bad either.^ not sure if this makes sense. will explain it in a future video.</content>

      <content>If you entered the 35.1, watch the 35.5-35.6 region if we hold there or reject, this is another decent entry i believe but just be cautious with your stop loss. i generally don't day trade much tbh. just that after yesterday's big drop it's lucrative to play these ranges.

      <content>Think we are range bound here for awhile. Would not be taking shorts at these prices. It's basically long C with tight stop aim for range high at D to go for a short and place a stop. Do this 1-2 swings and get out if you are day/swing trading. You can only do this after a big movement and only for your first 2-3 swings. I would probably stop around Wednesday. Fridays tend to more volatile. My Bias now is long cause R:R for shorting simply isn't good...I think we should still relief to 37.7k eventually, just be slow to ladder in positions you should be fine üëçüèº</content>

      <content>Quite interesting; I always notice this trend, I'll scour other exchanges or new options bids to confluence my ideas. Interesting how this squeeze on Bitstamp predated the movement on every other exchange subsequently that there would be a short squeeze.This has actually happened many times before. Bitcoin actually went to 8k a couple months back on a flash crash long squeeze on Binance US, that move also made me cautious and gave me confluence into predicting 66k was the top!</content>

      <content>already had my idea on this region 2 days back as you can see. but i tend to watch OI, liquidations and options ticker to find where to long exactly. 33.3k just felt like max pain to me. most people expect a swing failure bottom and the low to not break past previous lows which is exactly the reason why it needs to do that, to bait breakout traders and then trap them to provide liquidity for impetus to push the subsequent run-up. on the opposite end, it did this at the top too, went to highs of 65k, drop, rise back to 69k and bait the most amount of breakout bullish investors, and then reject so harshly to 33k, trapping them indefinitely. its beautiful to see üòÇ</content>

      <content>think we double test the top region above 37k, watch that carefully, put a trailing SL, if you haven't got out, consider getting out later but potentially we might squeeze higher as well. i'm not shorting only looking for relongs with SL.</content>

      <content>Next resistance for BTC would be 41.2 - 41.5, I would not mind gandering a small short there *if we get there* FOMC hearing this week, Powell discussing 4 interest rates hike this year, ideally means we still see 2022 as a very bad year for investing.

      <content>If you closed some where I suggested at 36.6, this region is a possible reshort at 38-38.2k. Alternatively, if you are low leveraged, just hold it and ignore this (PA) Price Action.Still think we range and downtrend is still intact. Macro view remains unchanged. These areas are where I would be less speculative. I always expected a bounce at the end of January cause of the Tax Harvesting wash trade rule ending (mentioned this a couple of times).

      <content>For$BTC, Still at resistance but market hasn't move much at all. Would be more cautious when it consolidates so long, probably means continuation and that we need to tap a higher liquidity before we go down again.

      <content>Current Price (38975) this area is a pretty good region for a 1st short (38.9k) but bear in mind we can still go to (40.6k). How I would do it is to do a super tiny entry at the area for the 1st region and a more sizeable one at the 2nd region. Then watch the 40.6 area with alerts. This region is where I'd expect a rejection... and a reversal on the higher time frames if it's supposed to happen.</content>

      <content>just to be clear, most times when i take a position, i give room for error for it to go to my next region. what this means is don't go all-in on your short at 38.9k with your stop loss or liquidation at 40.6k, i always give allowance just in case we go to the 2nd region, unlikely but always plausible. basically, take a short, not large, but enough to make some profits. i generally just keep doing this and compounding profits.</content>

      <content>($BTC) Strict Invalidation at the 41.8k region. Weekends normally trap longs!A bit early on the short but I think we still retest supports:40.4k-40.6k (Weak)(80% Probability)39.5-39.8k (Weak) (Might not close here, just trailing SL to let it run deeper)37.8-38.5k (Strong) (40% probability)Should be flipping longs at the 37-38k region if we get there! Expecting a bounce if we get there! However as always, if we do breach 41k I will cut my positions, this is the last stand for this high volume node. watch this region very very closely if we do need to cut. my gut would be just to ladder in shorts slowly and use miniscule leverage. i generally keep shorts leverage much smaller than for longs.</content>

      <content>The 41k region is a key resistance after all... Depending on whether this holds, I would suggest the next strong resistance to be 46.5 - 46.9. I would cut the short if we breach previous highs again. Otherwise, think we sweep lows once again. As always, trade safely and not with high leverage, this is not a great region. Don't fancy it too much... Perhaps looking into some US Stocks/Forex might be better. Shorting is generally not advised when we already dropped so much...</content>

The next real resistance would be 46.5-46.9k. Opting to sit out till then cause I am not convinced we fully broke this region yet. Just a feeling...Basically: Closed off all my earlier longs from 34/35k at 41.5k fully already just looking for shorts now but being patient and slow with it.(US Stocks) Only holding$ABNBpositions, exiting slowly.

      <content>As mentioned earlier here, held my 34.3k longs to the resistance regions but the attempts to flip short I've had to cut. It's a good thing we rode the large longs up but had to give back some profits to the market from the shorts. It's part of trading I guess!Depending on the conviction you should opt for different sizing. General rule of thumb is to always go less size on shorts cause it's just generally a poorer alternative.I normally opt for 1-3x Leverage for Longs & 0.5-1.5x Leverage for Shorts. This would ultimately depend on your own account size as well.On a 2x Leverage long, it requires a 50% drop to liquidate you.On a 2x Leverage short, it requires a 100% gain to liquidate you.Even above that, since you're normally DCA-ing your entries, we essentially have no chance of liquidations unless we have black-swan flash crash events. However, in view of such lowered leverages. Most ideas & positions I hold out for 1-2 weeks normally.Hope that makes sense!</content>

      <content>(Crypto) Still in our low volume node, think we can ride this a little further, especially on alts as well. We should see 45k holding today. However, given the speed of the movement up, I think we reject quite hard on resistance. Best to put orders well in advance to take profits, DCA up all the way to around the 46.5-46.9 region!(US Stocks) Still in$ABNB. Still patient. Waiting for$TSLAas well!</content>

      <content>(Crypto) Think we are in a resistance area; idea is to DCA your exits otw up as I mentioned. Just ladder exits and put a trailing stop loss if you're gonna exit soon. (That's the best way I found) Pretty difficult to time this exactly... Crypto really moves so much faster compared to stocks. This trading style might not be for everybody.. Hope everyone got out! Think we still have to be cautious here. Just a relief rally imo.</content>

      <content>Didn't exactly hit 46.5k, we only went up to 46050. That's kind of what happens when you try to time it too exactly. Fortunately we at least took the longs up to there. CPI news should push the broader markers down. Not opting for shorts at the moment. Just buying put options on certain stocks that's all, largely puts for TSLA at 910 targeting wayy lower 750 even but i'll watch as it goes there ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§´</content>

      <content>Hi guys! Just a weekend update. Think overall trend is still down, max we can possibly see for a resistance would be 43.3-43.8k. With the CPI data, I am expecting more downside with Crypto. Same story for stocks, I think$ABNB&$TSLAare still good for sells or puts. With current market conditions I am just not keen on buying for long term holds or value investing. Value investing would imply I have to see value at these prices and I think further downside should not be ruled out!</content>

      <content>(Crypto) Entirety of this red region 44-46k is great for shorting on the larger time frame; i'm talking on a weekly candle basis... Just don't overleverage, you should be fine. If you entered earlier, i'll just lower the margin size when I reach breakeven, we should retrace back down to low 43s at least so you can definitely get some positions out and re-short again higher. These are not regions i'll be taking longs or being bullish already. Short R:R is better.</content>

      <content>(Short Guide on Crypto Futures)What I mean by this is that I am gonna ladder in shorts slowly but I expect a sweep of the lows eventually on the larger time frames so as long as you can hold down the position, I think long run it's okay. Besides funding pays shorters right now so you are paid to open shorts. Like I mentioned previously, my shorts I tend to use 0.5 - 1x Leverage, longs I use 0.5-2x Leverage for Crypto. (This is for me personally). This style is a much more slower, passive way towards trading; position trading. Just laddering in entries much slower for larger swings...i.e. if using a 1k account$200 at 44.8k short$200 at 46.5k short$200 at 46.9k shortThis employs $600/$1000 (60% Margin used) (0.6x Leverage) Which would put liquidation at 76.3k for your short contracts to liquidate you. Also makes your average entry around 45-46k overall; which is the end goal objective. If we break this region then i'll consider cutting losses. If eventually we take profit at range lows of 38k. That would still net a 21% gain off $600 which would be $126. That's a 12.6% off your $1000 Capital.I prefer to do this style as it's just overall less stress with lower leverage and in this choppy/rangy market. Accumulating 10-15% each month can still be a decent amount long term!Just teaching you guys how to ladder in positions. I think at the end of the day, patience overall makes all the difference.</content>

      <content>Also hope you guys cut your margin just now. 43.8 just wasn't a good initial entry but we did revisit it just now a 2nd time. Will look for 46.9 as a very very strong resistance. I've mentioned this number a couple of times earlier.I'll be waiting for 46.6-47.1k and otherwise I am just holding a small amount of shorts all the way up just in case we just go down. Nothing too significant. less than 0.2x Leverage. Obviously you could also long to 46k, but I just don't like the R:R of longing at this point already, won't be able to sleep at night... That's all the updates for Crypto till we reach my key regions.</content>

      <content>18th February Update:Summary on my own Trades$ROKUwent up another 5% from 168 but got rejected hard off the 9 day MA and 0.236. Entered at 141 but took profits quick on the rejection closing at 168-170. As I mentioned above, I am pretty quick to take profits on my longs in this market, which also makes me lose out on some potential gains but that's the nature of the market, I abide by the trend...Entered$ABNBat 140 and sold off at 163 so missed out the move from 163 to 190. But it‚Äôs also hard to time a perfect time if there are short squeezes. Not gonna beat myself up too much, profits are profits. I am not a perfectionist..Entered$BTCat 34k sold 41k, missed the move up after that but took the short from 43.8k to here, so I think that makes up for the mistimed long close‚Ä¶ Still in shorts but watching!Only one down a tiny bit for me is$FDXbought at 227/228, now trading at 226. Probably going to take the loss. But 0.5% loss on 1 trade, couldn‚Äôt care less since the rest made much more.</content>

      <content>18th February Update(Crypto)Possible Theory I drew out a couple days back for$BTCas you can see from this chart it hasn‚Äôt fallen yet. Looking for 38.6-37.8k for a 80% close on my short positions from 43.8k. Then I‚Äôll look for a bounce at D to consider a re-short with a trailing SL. The take profit after that will be determined by Fundamental Analysis news, so I can‚Äôt picture it right now‚Ä¶ Obviously still a long shot but I do like taking the larger swings as opposed to smaller ones which is why you can tell I mentioned I generally hold my positions for 1-2 weeks on low leverage and I just keep adding size till my bias is correct, this works if you are disciplined!</content>

I generally don't have the time for that either. This style works for my time schedule and outside commitments.(US Stocks) Took a small L on$FDX, like 0.5%, closed$ROKUin profit very hastily and fortunately, closed all the rest in profits for$ABNB.

      <content>21th February Update:(Crypto)Expecting a small bounce for$BTCto the 38.6-38.8k region from here (38.3k) at least and 39.5 at most (Even if we get here, I don't think we hold there for long, so I'm not gonna bother longing here). Clear downtrending pattern already. Think we can expect continuation. Still short-biased, rips are for shorting. I am still 60% closed so not re-shorting; just looking to time my short closes, and potentially re-short higher. It's a good rule of thumb of mine to just simply not short as it goes down. I prefer to ride with my current position as opposed to exposing myself to more margin risk. Generally, you can also short alts but I think that really depends on your contract size or if the alts can support your liquidity. I don't tend to do that cause alts have more volatility and might not have enough liquidity to support my size.(US Stocks)Why I say Lockheed Martin$LMTis because it's a defense stock that is tied in very closely with defense budget of the US and is mainly funded by that. Threats of war will of course highly correlate with this stock's prices. I'll do a video/newsletter on this. In short, the U.S. government has agreed to take delivery of 133-139 aircraft and 151-153 F-35 aircraft in 2022 and 2023. While we can expect the FEDs to cut spending, I don't think this will be in the form of defence budgets tightening as with a volatile economic/political climate, I would expect Defence to be of higher precedence even...</content>

      <content>(Crypto)I'll spell it out abit more explicitly. Closed 60% of my shorts already at C from B (average close of 38.2), not longing from C to D due to poor R:R, just laddering in re-shorts of the same size of 60% at D (38.6-38.8k 30/60%) and (39.5-39.8k 30/60%). Something like this. Hope this makes sense! Update again soon.(US Stocks)Stacking up on$LMTslowly but it already did a run-up. I've been stacking for a year now. It's just a more stable defence stock. Also waiting for my$TSLAclose at under $800, potentially $750.As always, NFA and DYOR ü§ôüèª</content>

      <content>21st February Update:As suggested we're making a run-up to 39.5k region, I'll look for closes on longs or re-shorts there.As per yesterday's poll i'll try to do 1 quick update per day. At least giving my inter-range for trading. However, if you're taking such trades I would think that the hit rate would be much lower. I think that so far I have been pretty spot on but like I said, with greater frequency, you would have to take lower probability trade setups more on the intra day. Still juggling my school & work commitments cause I don't intend to full-time trade for the basis of mental sanity and also in pursuit of diversifying my income/cash flow further.As such i'll probably structure and label it into 2 setups.(1) Weekly High Probability Set-ups:This is what I personally trade due to my time schedule but i'll give you guys (2) as an add-on but i'll put a disclaimer and say that (2) is not what i'm personally trading. I only trade (1).(2) Daily Inter-range Key Support and Resistance Levels for Crypto, Stocks & Eventually ForexThis will probably include some news as well daily, whatever interesting I'm reading I guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç Will optimise the postings out more in due course!

      <content>21st February UpdateBTC & Crypto(1) Larger Time Frame Swings- Still on a Downtrend, we could see relief to 39-40k but even then this will be short-lived. On a low leverage these prices shouldn‚Äôt bother you. Alternatively would be of course OTM put options which I personally employ but nothing too fancy. By laddering exits on shorts as suggest from 38.6 - 37.8k, I think you should have perfectly captured the bottom at 37.9 yesterday. I'm only beginning to ladder re-shorts now.(2) Short-Term Trade Range:-$BTCfaces strong resistance at 39.6-39.8k. Laddering in shorts with an invalidation at 40.3k or tighter is a possible play. Trend still down till we sweep the lows properly, consolidate and hold. Then we‚Äôll have to watch if the floor holds.US Stocks(1) Long Term Holds- Stuff I think that will still retain value in for a long-term hold. Covered Calls on$Tstill work. AT&T is still a necessity and is still profitable as both a business and for doing a CC strategy. If you don‚Äôt have enough capital to do CCs. Consider doing PMCCs.(2) Inter-Day Trading Range-$TSLAputs till under 800 still logical to me.$FSLY$SHOP&$CLOVat reaching very oversold territories at 18.70, 2.11 and 650 respectively at GMT+8 11am now.

Think next support is 35.8 - 36.3k, will possibly look for closes on the shorts there. However, I think this is a weak support. If they give you 33/34k I will definitely put a trailing stop loss/take profits. Still in my put options and fully re-shorted already. Re-shorted the 60% I closed 30% at 38.7k and 30% at 39.5k. This de-risks your previous positions and compounds even more profits!Y'all should be good in profits now ü§ôüèª$TSLAputs still waiting for close!</content>

      <content>22 February 2021:(Crypto)Still downtrending. Any rips should be short-lived, wouldn't consider any longs until 35.8-36.3k which we are fairly close now! Just make sure you ladder your exits well in that region! If you want to run it down you can place a trailing SL/TP when it reaches under 36.3k; what this does is if it continues down you give it the chance to, however if it bounces up this strat immediately TPs. I'll look for re-shorts after closing this bounce from 35.8-36.3k if the bounce is strong.As I mentioned won't be doing alts, unless ETH, BNB, FTT, KCS. No small caps, just coins with high correlation to BTC/Crypto Market Potentially!</content>

      <content>What I mean by the last part was that we choose high correlation alt coins to short in confluence with a downtrending$BTC. This will make you more profits with less leverage as alts tend to fall harder than BTC. This takes a bit of tweaking cause I correlate this data with BTC dominance and do a simple correlation graph to see what works the best for this strategy. Those I listed are what I personally do.This strategy lets you take the same position with less leverage to make the same gains.</content>

      <content>22nd February Update(Crypto)Trailing SL triggered at 36.5k for$BTCso took off 30% some profits there. Still in about 60-70% shorts entered at my 2nd reshort of 39.5k. Whenever we reach an area of support I tend to employ a trailing TP then just walk away. If we continue down, we let it run.Knowing when to put a trailing SL especially placed at a support region can be crucial.Anyway, not too concerned, just a squeeze for late shorters - maybe a quick tap up to 38.4-38.6k for liquidity but I believe trend is still down! If we get another retest down to 36.3k region (+- 0.3k) I would put another trailing SL! Hope this makes sense.(US Stocks)Same old. Puts in$TSLAstill not closed, have time cause it's a 6 months options contract. Not suffering too heavily in Theta Decay. Possibly laddering buys for$SHOP$CLOVvery soon.Overall a pretty decent month so far!</content>

      <content>I think this can be a saviour at times! Better off than trying to pick a perfect bottom to close, when we reach nearing a support region just put a trailing SL for 50% of suggested close and 50% at targeted close for the amount you want to close. So if it bounces you'll be guaranteed to take profits. Like I said, no one ever died taking profits.Sorry if I am a lil spammy lately, trying to do as suggested and update more often!</content>

      <content>Not my cleanest cut, should have held it a little longer, closed some at 38.4-38.6 cause I was a lil panicky. Should trust the gut more in the future. Taking 1-2 days off unless Crypto unless it reaches where I want to long or short. Not trading this inter-range as it consolidates. I don't like trading Wave CDE on the ABCDE Elliot wave on principle. (Refer to Image)Closed 90% of my short futures but still have put options fro 44k so not re-shorting at the moment. Won't be too bummed even if we do go down; still as I said, trendline still bearish.</content>

      <content>Didn't get here unfortunately. I'll honestly not try to time it so much when. Made a mistake by cutting some at 38.4, when my leverage and size were actually good enough to hold the short down forever. I think that's the "problem" with trying to be more active. The more I stare at it, the more itchy fingers I get. I believe a lower leveraged/sized larger swing outweighs touching a position everyday even!Gonna optimise again. However puts on stocks still made me a decent chunk and I do still have crypto put options so it's okay! Still up a bunch for this month üëåüèº Hope you guys are too!</content>

      <content>41.7 - 42.5k is a strong area of resistance for BTC. I'll probably opt to trailing stop loss if we break 40k and take a full profit at the suggested resistance, perhaps even flip short at 41.7-42.5k at the higher end of that resistance.

      <content>Still holding most positions till minimally next week to reassess, will employ trailing stop losses or a stop loss in entry still, don't think we crash twice so fast without squeezing late shorts, so doubt we retrace back to entries. (UNLESS WW3 happens which then it's entirely out of my control).Off the bat, resistance areas would be:835-840$TSLA(already 820 on pre-market)163-165$ABNB745$SHOPpotentially the only one I might take profits here, -$CLOV(we had a crazy run on this 20-30% last day)All of these should be in decent 10-20% profits without any leverage/margin already. I am not buying to hold at these prices, think Macro and economic climate still too bearish. So gonna opt to take profits faster.</content>

      <content>Been viewing$SHOP$CLOVmore often than other the previous few days, cause I mentioned specifically these 2 were heavily oversold. I think$CLOValready did a fair enough bounce, waiting on$SHOPto go a bit higher!Unfortunately if you weren't awake at 3am last night it would have been difficult to catch good entries but I still think we have legs on$SHOP,$TSLAfor a little bit.$CLOV,$ABNBand$BTCwould not be a strong buy for me here.1 Key Indicator you can use as a contrarian indicator would be to look at the VIX or VVIX levels; these are inverse ETFs, generally if VIX is above 35 and VVIX is 150 or closing there, we can see it as a sign of possible relief. Many people use VIX to hedge, so if it reaches these levels you can expect the opposite movement on the general markets. As people take profits on inverse ETFs, this can also provide short-term relief indirectly to the underlying ETF. There are a few indicators I personally use: RSI, VPVR, Max Pain Options, VIX/VVIX Levels, your usual MA & Stochastics. Will try teach them slowly here.</content>

      <content>$TSLAat 845 onwards right now as I suggested is a sell for me on a short-term time frame. Been targeting this number in both the groups under 750 I was signalling a buy. Do think we have potential for more upward movements but if you have any leveraged/margin positions I would be at least taking profits. Not opening puts or shorting yet but closing call options.$BTCat resistance for me. As I mentioned earlier 40.5k onwards is not a bad position to attempt short ladders.$CLOVI think will meet short-term resistance at 2.8. Not a buy here nor short. Just areas to continually take profits from our buys a week ago.$SHOPI am still holding. Being patient with this awhile longer, still in profit but not a lot. Initial entry still 650.$ABNBhope you took some profits at the resistance I mentioned a few days prior. I am still holding my spot positions for these. Not too concerned.

      <content>Same plan on$BTCas a week ago. Tiny short ladders or take profits at our current resistance. However, given the nature of this latest$BTCmovement. I am more inclined we do a liquidation cascade on shorts to tap into the 41.4-42.5k region.If I were to short and prospectively aim for a perfect entry i'll try 42.5-42.9k. There's strong liquidity to tap there. Anything before that on a down-bias should just be tiny shorts or take profits on longs. General bias and trend is still down for me. I do not believe we are in a bull-run period! Put Options may not be entirely bad if you got 3 months out.</content>

      <content>28th February UpdateIn summary:$TSLAladdered sells all the way up to 880, heavy resistance there.$CLOVanything above 2.8 is good for closes on call options. Spot I think still can hold$BTCcurrently in a close region for any longs. Shorts I will only consider 41.4-42.5k and with a positive kurtosis and right skewed with more positions at the higher end.The rest not moving much, refer to previous updates!</content>

      <content>1st March Update:Both$TSLA$CLOVstill playing out as expected, at $871 & $2.80 respectively. I am closing for these slowly.$BTCcurrently at 43.5k; if in a short I think we will retrace later. If you're not too levered I think I will wait it out. Still think this is a significant resistance area. I'll flip bias if we do reclaim 46/47 & hold.</content>

      <content>Still not convinced by the$BTCmovement just yet. A reclaim of 46/47 and hold would be very bullish though. Took majority profits of$CLOV&$TSLAalready. Still in my$SHOPto wait for $745.

This goes for my general stance on US Stocks as well. Might flip bearish. Already out on$CLOV$TSLA$ABNBfully, left positions on$SHOP.$BTCstill on my put positions from a few weeks back at 44k, bias for me still down, not convinced till we break 46/47k & hold (which i also doubt will happen).</content>

      <content>3 March Update:42.6-42.9k is another crucial level for$BTCto hold. Still think the trend is down but if you ever want to de-risk or lower your margin/leverage of your shorts, you can close some positions there. I find it easier to hold positions when they're smaller. Less stressful as well! Looking more into stocks at the moment cause the FOMC hearing & Global Tensions make it that there is quite a lot of liquidity and risk on movements to take.Potentially looking at puts for$TSLAsoon now, considering we're double testing out 879-882 region. Starting to ladder in small puts. Think this goes to 920 at max on the short time-frame, so I'll ladder in with knowledge of that.$CLOV$ABNBnot trading at the moment, fully out of calls still.$SHOPstill holding awhile more as I mentioned!</content>

      <content>$CLOVif you are still holding buys I suggest to cut. I was just buying for the short squeeze potential at $2 to $2.80. Already a 40% gain.$TSLAattempting puts to ladder at 895-910. I think if you spread out your shorts/puts/takeprofits on this region; we will retrace after.Ruble has been crashing hard, been just researching into Russian Banks & Defence Stocks lately. Still holding my$LMT!For$BTCif I am still on my shorts I will probably deleverage some then attempt to short higher. However, I still believe we see lower in the coming months. I think it's foolhardy to think we don't touch 30ks again. Still holding my put options from 44k.Working on some comprehensive PDF trading guides; will send here next week!</content>

      <content>For$BTC42.6k did not hold. If you are in shorts I think finally at long last you can put a stop loss in take profit. Just hold out a little longer.

      <content>4th March:For BTC shorts from 42.9k-44k. Think we break under 40k for one more sweep. If we're in a consolidation wedge which is what I am thinking. Safe TP around 38.8k mark. I think if we get a move it should be now. So I am finally putting stops but I'll try to let this run to TP. Hard to explain my ideas through text but general idea is in the charts.</content>

      <content>4th March 2022:For$BTCyou can be patient. Think the longs are already trapped; Looking at 38.8k prospectively, i'll reassess later how and where to ladder out shorts to take profits or roll longer. There are 2 waves I drew: one is a elliot extension wave, one is a consolidation wave to form a triangle wedge. Not sure which one forms yet. Leaning on triangle wedge since we're still far out from any news like the FOMC hearing or crucial CME expiration dates. As I mentioned above, I didn't get a perfect entry either... mostly started laddering shorts at 42.9-44k. I mentioned I would cut if we did get 46/47k. It's okay to not be perfect all the time, just understand the general trend and slowly ladder!$TSLAso far has been playing out very perfectly. Took profits from $730 at $870-882 and flipped to puts from 878-882. Holding these and not adding. I principally don't add on my size even if they're small. I am okay with smaller profits as long as they're consistent!Will chart this out by next week. So far still a decent week!</content>

      <content>38.8k should be a safe TP. Think we break under 40k and potentially consolidate in this region awhile longer till the FOMC hearing... I would probably close and opt to re-short closer to hearing date.As I mentioned, longs are trapped already. I have been short-biased the entire month if you can't tell... Don't think we break to 46/47k anytime soon actually.Watching$ABNB$TSLAfor calls in the next few weeks. I do enjoy buying the dip on these...

      <content>For$BTCI think the lowest we can go to me is 36.5-36.8 in the short time frame. Don't think we go down too deep just yet. But even then I think we do a final wick back up above 40k to aim for D before going down. D would be around 41.2-41.8 imo. You can take some profits and then reshort or just hold the short down. I think either way, i'll still be holding some shorts down as I expect lower for$BTCeventually! As long as you get paid in funding, nothing to worry about for holding shorts.</content>

Yet, relative to its pre-pandemic levels, Roku has 60% more users, 145% more revenues and 13X the EBITDA.It indeed looks like we're free falling but on a technical standpoint we're at long-standing support. Above this, yes, revenue misses due to supply chain issues from the pandemic in the q4 earnings are a point of concern. However, this can be relatively easily fixed over time as governments start learning to live with COVID. This just depends on the industry."Based on the likelihood that a meaningful portion of the $60bn-$70bn of traditional TV advertising market will migrate to connected TV platforms in the coming years, we have maintained our modest sized position during this period of tempered viewership growth."Long-term still think it has potential.

Using monthly options for this.Bearish on Crypto on a weekly time frame still. Not trading too heavily on crypto at the end of this wedge.

      <content>19th March Update:Most stocks on a major run-up today specifically$SHOP,$CLOV,$ABNB,$TSLAall still doing well.  I am just taking profits for$TSLAand$ABNB. Did not take any positions for the others. Still think there is a bit more upside for most counters. But I won't be a buyer for those that already did 20-30% in the last couple of days. Feds did a very low interest rate hike and Powell basically suggested that the Economy is still strong. I don't believe we reach ATH this year still.If you want a decent R:R play that hasn't flew yet, I might look at$ROKUon Monday, currently at 124. Will look for puts starting end of next week I think!</content>

      <content>$BTCstill in this wedge, not too convinced we get out of this downtrend pattern. I think here is okay for a low-leverage short. Current Price (41.8k) Just ladder in. Even the most we can see is 43.8k I presume. Think we still see 30k again. Still missing the D and E waves.</content>

      <content>Just broke down into 42.3k again... My average sells were about 43.2k. Took only about 400k in Contract Positions but happy with the entry. Generally I don't tend to shorts add along the way down, I add shorts only on the way up.Always remember, buy on dumps, sell on pumps. Simple logic!Will place a tight stop loss on the short here at 42.6k, which I expect will trigger but I am okay with taking profits at this support even though I still possibly expect 38.6-39.3k.

Might have to look into some alts.So for instance, if we are trading on support at 42.3-42.5k, and resistance at 42.7-43.1k, the next time it bounces off there we shift both support and resistance tighter by a margin of 0.786 based on fibo. But bear in mind this is a smaller triangle within the larger wedge. I'd just take these trades if I were day trading. Still in my 43.2k shorts but closing some more to de-risk. Will re-short higher, possibly at 42.8-42.9k.</content>

      <content>24th March:This is how the larger wedge looks right now. Not entirely out of the woods yet. Already closed most of my shorts yesterday in small profits as I mentioned to aim to re-short higher. Starting to ladder in shorts here now with a tight SL at 43.9-44.1k. Just playing the triangles. Don't think we break out yet. Still going to be ranging, so going to play the triangle for 1-2 more waves.</content>

      <content>27th March Update:Waiting for the Market Open still on the TSLA put options. Think this is still in an area of resistance. Managed to average out my previous shorts and deleverage. Still holding some shorts but I am still averaging in slowly. I still am on the belief we are not recovering into a full-blown bull market. I think the macro conditions have improved with the low interest rate hikes but given the upcoming FOMC hearings and hikes. Don‚Äôt think we get ATH for$BTCor$TSLAlike some are suggesting. In this scenario, I would just be going low leverage/margin for shorts and puts and waiting for it to truly bottom before buying heavily. It‚Äôs hard to time the top but I don‚Äôt believe we have bottomed so still biased down.Tomorrow onwards also going to be providing some analysis on FX markets, will share more details on this later but largely the NY times. Been backtesting for awhile and trading on a smaller size but the trading style will be daily and different from the Crypto/Stocks one. You can follow along with this log for this as well if you are interested in FX. If you're new to FX markets, have a guide coming soon too so don't worry!</content>

      <content>[Forex analysis] EUR/USD 4HAs we start the week, price is currently range bound between 1.0900 and 1.1137. we can expect to open potential long positions soon and ride it all the way up and out of the range as price comes down to visit our Demand zones marked out on the 15M and 1H.Still, until I receive confirmation that price wants to go up from my demand zones marked out in the form of (1) a change of character (CHoCH) or (2) 2 Higher Highs formed, I will still be entertaining quick shorts from my 1H supply area as Price is still bearish in 4H substructure.</content>

      <content>29th March Forex updateEUR/USD M15Closed out my entire long position from last night as stated when price reached the 1H Supply zone. (Overall +11.7%)After putting in a series of Higher highs today, the price narrative is now confirmed bullish so as of now we can look to long the market again from the new M15 Demand zone. The potential take profit areas will be the new M15 Supply zone above (conservative) & the current 4H high at 1.1370 (aggressive).Still, I will be wary of a reversal to the downside as price had created a trendline of liquidity (aka stop loss orders waiting to be taken out) on its way up.</content>

      <content>Close TP is around 47185, flip long is about 47125-47165 I think. Put an SL below and play the range. My stance is to play the range from A, B, C, D, E waves but be quicker to cut longs with an SL and be more willing to hold shorts with a more flexible buffer at this region. I think after the consolidation wedge forms we will break down back under 46/47k in the long-term view.</content>

      <content>EUR/USD FX update:Would have gotten stopped out by 2 pips if entered a short at the first supply zone. I personally did not enter the trade as price action on the lower time frames (1minute) was not very clean. To me, the Supply zone at the top is still valid to trade from as there is a build up of liquidity just right below it.Not much opportunities today as price looks like it is currently in an indecision phase for tonight's NY session so we stay cash. Still up over 10RR on the week, going to stay patient.As for concerns on how to go about trading this strategy effectively for FX and others too, a new guide will be coming out soon so not to worry!</content>

      <content>Just my 2 cents, you can also opt to put a trailing SL under 45.7k in a bit like I mentioned... so basically we let it run down and give it the chance to, but be ready to take profits since we close to my support regions already. I expect there to be some relief soon. I'll at least close majority when we get into 45315-45511 and flip a small long with a tight SL.If all these methodologies seem confusing for you. Not to worry... Going to release a series of videos on a new website on how to specifically ladder & place SLs soon. Existing users in this chat will get it free.

      <content>Ah stops triggered! Luckily I did put a SL in TP at 46.6k. Still a decent day yesterday, Ideally I just TP at different ranges as opposed to taking so many trades. I think part of the problem of doing these short-term trades is that I lose sight of the bigger picture. Was attempting to re-short but didn't fill cause I fell asleep. Problem is also these odd hours I sometimes just am too tired. Might go back to slightly longer time frame plays.</content>

      <content>In all honesty, even though I didn't close at the exact bottom at 44.2k, taking the short from 47.7k to 45.5k is good enough. After trading for awhile, I know better than to hold a position too long or adjust my profit regions too much. It's a good thing we took the day break as it flew back to 47k earlier today as well. Just got back into my short here. Will start monday off with a stocks update!</content>

I‚Äôll be taking shorts at resistance but no longs on supports. Think the trend is down on a mid-term time frame. I‚Äôm still in my short so not re-shorting‚Ä¶Both 46355 and 46785-46855 are the resistances for this range. I‚Äôll probably opt to close some at 45030-45155. But I‚Äôll hold some for even lower. Looking at macro conditions with Interest Rate Hikes next month looming. Potentially we could revisit 41.3-41.7k again.$TSLAas I mentioned in the other group we should see some re-tracement down to 1030 but I don‚Äôt see any cause of concern in the next few weeks for any lower than that. I am just not buying calls at these prices right now though.</content>

      <content>4th April Commodities & Forex:The global economy is still largely affected by rising inflation rates so its a good time to look at safe haven assets like gold, although gains will be modest. It also  just bounced right off a strong fibonacci level at 1890 last week. I will be bullish if it can continue to go up, preferbly past the 1965 levels.For this week's outlook on EUR/USD, all I am interested in now is for price to break out of the range it is in before establishing a directional bias. Other than that, a crucial price level to look at for price to make a huge reversal up to new structural highs will be at 1.10050 to 1.09700. Will be monitoring price action in that zone closely.</content>

      <content>4th April Forex EUR/USD UpdateAs predicted on the weekly outlook earlier today, Price is now approaching an extreme point of interest/Demand Zone. (Meaning the gains could be quite huge depending on how long you want to hold the trade - normally I would take partials to end the night and leave runners for higher take profit levels)So for tonight's session, both zones are valid to take a trade from.

      <content>Honestly I am going to start closing slowly and putting a stop loss to take profit here...Good enough already. Basically stop limit, (reduce only) so any break above 44550 will trigger buys to close my short up to 44600.Trigger Price 44565 Limit Price 44595.43.8-44.1k is my support I am looking at. Will take 90% close there and leave the remainder to run down. I am looking to close majority already.</content>

Already closed all my shorts yesterday at 43.8k, now in an extremely small long.We either wait for a retest of lows at C, under 43k, if that holds, we buy.

      <content>11th April Crypto Update:Current Price 43.1k, where we got stopped out at entry the previous time. I don't mind a re-long attempt here. Reason I chose to just get stopped out and not hold the long is because I don't want the stress of holding an underwater long position throughout the weekend anyway. However, I think this is a second opportunity to catch a move for a squeeze up. I do think we are going to squeeze out some shorts tomorrow. We will have to tap liquidity above 44k at least once before going down.Regions for long close and/or flip short would be 44035-44068 (Likely)I will go for re-shorts at both of these resistance but with a strategy of laddering in both entries and putting a stop loss at entry after each rejection. No matter what I would want to hold a short into the upcoming FOMC hearing I feel.</content>

      <content>For Crypto:Current$BTCPrice: 40.2kI honestly think we get a relief move up before a continuation downwards, it's just very dangerous to long here with the global conditions. However, if you want you can punt a small long. I would prefer to wait for 42.8k and above to start laddering in shorts. Otherwise just holding in cash.For Stocks:Most Counters haven't reached a floor yet. Think$TSLAneeds to test the 800s region to get a strong proper bounce. Can hold the $1080 puts further. Generally be buying at least 2-4 months on your expirations if you can afford it. Easier to hold this way!</content>

Still not a bad position for a small long if you want, significant resistance only above 42.7k. Bear in mind, this is just a relief rally before further downside imo. This means you have to be quick while taking profit if you are in longs. Just my take on it!</content>

      <content>It is a bank holiday so thought I would share some educational content for you guys instead on why I also use the "Smart Money Concept" (SMC) to trade (fx) markets. Take a read toimprove your understanding to why the market moves the way it does!To prevent confusion, the retail trading pattern / support resistance levels DO WORK, but in my experience one has to go a little deeper than just simple support and resistance lines to be able to trade off them effectively & SMC is a great way to help yourself understand why price moves the way it does instead of just thinking we got manipulated when trades don't go our way.If interested, more resources are available on our site for you guys!</content>

      <content>But on the higher time frames (4H), if you want to swing trade (typically 1-2 weeks) this pair instead of day trade, I would take a close look at opening shorts in these 2 zones to ride prices down as price will remain overall bearish as long as these 2 zones are not broken.</content>

      <content>21st April Update EUR/USDPrice reacted perfectly off my M15 supply marked out on Tues for a 11RR trade but I didnt take it as was outside my hours.. oh well but we stick to the plan and timing, setups will come eventually. With this high RR strat, I just need 2/3 good trades/month to reap good profits from the markets üëåüèªüëåüèªDon‚Äôt be a slave to the markets!</content>

      <content>22 April Crypto Update:Got our 38-39k long close into a 42.8k flip short yesterday! Looking at a lot lower as we get to the FOMC hearing. Opting to close 30-40% at B, and letting the rest run down. Potentially reopen-ing same size at C but will reassess there. SL for remaining size at Entry A.</content>

      <content>Forex Update EUR/USDPrice actually did give me an entry with a solid CHoCH on the M1 after price reacted from my M15 supply zone.Already fully closed it at 7.8RR though, knowing that it may well just retrace back to the zones at the top which seems like good point of interests according to my  rules.But nice trade bagged in less than an hour ü§ôüèø</content>

      <content>Forex Update 25th AprilPrice melted this afternoon during London session timing (2pm-ish) again.. New York sessions at night have been kinda bad the last month or so in terms of number of high probability setups.. But markets do get boring in stretches at times so not to worry, more setups will be coming eventually.But for now, these are the areas we can look to short from to ride the bear trend, unless price turns bullish from the Weekly Demand, then I'll update again on areas to long from.</content>

      <content>27th April Forex EUR/USD updateHuge huge selling pressure recently on this pair so will only be entertaining shorts until price shows bullish structure on the 4H.The zones marked out are the ones we can short from. The lowest one is definitely at a higher risk of being ran eventually but still valid with a CHoCH on the LTF.</content>

      <content>Next FOMC hearing is on June 15-16.Till then I think we range for US Stocks & Crypto.. Potential swing longs soon at the low 800s for$TSLA!I am also not in total agreement that I/R hikes can go super high because the US Gov would then not be able to afford the I/R payments on the $30 Trillion National Debt, which is soon to be $100 Trillion.The Feds unfortunately have no choice but to keep I/R management within the 25-50 basis point range and taper it accordingly.Sure, the citizens have to suffer inflation but bringing it down too fast would cause the bankruptcy of the state if they can't pay sovereign debt off.</content>

      <content>For forex, doesn't seem like there's any interesting setups tonight. But a textbook entry happened again this afternoon during London session which presented a 1:17RR trade.Did a case study on it anyways so if you're interested can take a look! The market always repeats itself.  Market structure break, find your areas to trade from on the M1 after a CHoCH, enter trade. Booom üòÆ‚Äçüí®</content>

      <content>29th April Crypto Update:For Crypto, already closed what I wanted to close at this region. Holding the rest down. My style of trading involves a lot of waiting but I do believe it's more profitable in the long-term for me!Did not get C to re-short but still holding 60% in shorts from 42.7k. Not panicking...

      <content>Feb 29th US Stocks Update:Moving day. Closing$TSLAputs here at 865-870, flipping into calls temporarily - Waiting for a double bottom to form and for one more sweep of the lows to enter into calls 840-865 is a decent region to DCA calls with a flexible SL. Early on our SL has to be more flexible before switching to a trailing SL once we get profits.I think there's still time till the hearing and the interest rates hikes will be tapered slowly. Won't see an immediate market crash.</content>

      <content>Regarding the call options for$TSLAhere. I do believe we see a relief rally into 900s for$TSLAbut my belief is that the extenuating trend is still down. Once we get 900s I will watch very closely for a close. Off the bat, once I am fully in my positions I am going to put TP targets from 988-1028 and a loose trailing SL at 900 and once we get above 950 an extremely tight trailing SL. I am honestly happy with taking profits quickly for calls in a bearish market or recession climate.</content>

      <content>Not sure why I kept posting so many updates about a double bottom sweep for$TSLAand second guessed myself so much. I initially just wanted to enter lumpsum at 865, waiting for another sweep to $840 is just foolhardy and unnecessary. Not much difference when we waited so long for these prices. Now my average is about 870 instead of 865 but whatever... -,-Fully in my buy call postitions already here anyway, holding till $900 at least. Will stop pussyfooting.Plan is as written above...</content>

      <content>We indeed only had 1 proper tap above 42.7k for$BTCüòÖ Still in the short!Reason why I am still in this$BTCshort: I want to protect this short as best I can. Sure, I can attempt to predict a support and re-short higher to increase profits BUT I am hesistant we get a lot of good bounces along the way down since there is no significant support region. Less stressful for me just holding it down and actively taking profits at each support with the percentage of TP depending on the strength of the support.Increased activity may come with increased profits but it also comes with increased stress. Learnt this the hard way in the past when I fat fingered large contracts.I am a day trader on some days depending on the setup but this larger time frame swing trading is a style that works for me.Higher probabilistic wins. Perhaps less profit. but less leverage. less button pushing. less stress.</content>

      <content>Laddering in some small puts here at $905 maybe 20-30% first for$TSLA.

      <content>one more break under 34k i'll put a tight trailing SL perhaps to a few hundreds. if we run to my regions i'll punt a close. if we get stopped out, also fine by me. we're getting really close on HTF support regions. patience. gotta close fast for this tp, don't think we get a long sustained drop. quick tap.</content>

      <content>Let me try and explain something here:You got bottom liquidation levels at 32.6k for$BTCand 2404 for$ETHaccording tohyblockcapital.comAfter that the delta is quite red. What does this mean?We're getting quite close to a region of support. From what I understand, it means there's no more money to be made from liquidating sizeable longers after that number - so any further selling after that has to be made from spot selling. The question you have to ask yourself is will price action be dictated by the futures or spot market. Generally, the former has control because futures volume is multitudes bigger than spot. However, if there is a flight to safety and spot just gives up and dumps, then who props up the futures price? This normally is in the prerogative of the exchange to hold prices steady - using something called the Insurance Fund.Anyway, i'll try explain this concept sometime. TLDR; we got no one left to kill below this price point so if we drop it has to be spot dumping, but a very possible relief region coming soon.</content>

      <content>only left my 10% in shorts left, rest are in stables since november last year as you guys know. i think in this market, as long as you are not losing money & you got some ammo to buy the dip later on - you'll be fine. i will deploy the mother load and start scaling in my dry powder in Q3 i presume.for now, i believe for$BTCwe are going to break down below 30k and look towards 28k for a close on the final shorts and small flip longs.exact numbers later!very heavy market these few days... i'm not going to be a fudder, but macro conditions are really bad, there will be some crypto alts that will go close to zero. I still believe in stocks - things like$TSLA$AAPLare still good long term investments.</content>

      <content>when i say crypto alts that will go close to zero - i think things that did a massive run-up last year like ($LUNA,$SOL) with eroding utility or a poor protocol construct are at wayyy biggest risk than things like an large exchange token ($BNB,$FTT).just fyi, i'm still in my tiny bit of shorts. i changed my stance and will not be entering into longs here at 28k. this is not a market i want to be longing or buying yet.i do believe we see lower in Q3 - if we get a full-blown recession - my exact figures are much deeper - always have been. hope everyone is safe!</content>

      <content>Over on the forex markets, going into July, the EUR/USD pair seems to be showing signs of reversal to the upside now, after my call for shorts from 1.077 levels earlier this month which played out well.The bias now will be for one final move down before price potentially reverses. So will look for price to give us some tells & areas to long after the major news play out at the start of July.But if price does not bounce out of key support levels well, look for the pair to continue its HTF narrative down.</content>

Will wait for a few days to let price play itself out for a clearer picture of the direction it wants to go.In the meantime, the only scalp setup I'm interested in tonight would be something like this.</content>

      <content>Forex update 26/7: EUR/USDAn update on the overall movement EUR/USD. Since last week's call for price to drop down to 1.011 levels (Marked in blue arrow), price has consolidated for awhile before finally approaching the targeted levels.Did catch a 14RR short following the trend last week but other than that & a short today during London's session (didn't take), there weren't any high probability setups for me to share during the consolidation..My views on this pair for the next few days are again marked in blue on the right of the chart. Overall bias is still bearish for now.</content>

      <content>Forex Update 27/7: EUR/USDPrice did indeed just reach my final targeted level (posted last week) yesterday midnight.Price is now reacting off of that level/zone and showing signs of a temporary pull back up to the zone marked on top.The scenarios I'm looking at for the next few days are marked on the charts!</content>

      <content>28th July FOMC Update:So we just got our 75 basis points hike in the FOMC Hearing a couple minutes ago. Powell has pivoted to a more dovish stance, hinting to taper back hikes on a meeting by meeting basis in the case if CPI & PCE remain softer in the next few months - which is why we see this push up across the board.My opinion still remains that CPI & PCE won't be controlled with such a "soft" hike and Powell will still have to continue cooling off the market; tldr: bear trend continues till inflation is properly controlled. Not really looking at new entries for puts and re-shorts, still holding my original ones.In other news,$METAjust missed earnings in this latest tech earnings; this might be one to look out for that I believe still has deeper to go if they keep self-sabotaging the platform with their poor acquisitions and restructuring.</content>

      <content>Forex Update 28/7 EUR/USDMarkup for tonight's session and as pointed out on Tues, we were looking for a temporary pull back up to 1.022 levels (the zone above) & it played out nicely this afternoon. However, I only trade New York sessions at night so I missed it.Still, will be looking for price to break the highs now with or without a temporary pullback to 1.012 area.Price action is looking cleaner recently thus I see more high probability trades coming back again!

      <content>Crypto Update August 2022:$BTCprice right now is ranging between 23-24k, I am still in the belief that the recession isn‚Äôt over and we have yet to establish strong enough lows for a reversal.That being said, I think there is some upside here to tap liquidity. Considering we have until September 20-21 to the next hearing, barring that there is not extenuating bad news or war crisis the next few months, we can hope to tap 29.5-31.1k as a proper resistance before continuation of the downtrend on Crypto. As of now, if I had longs, I would consider closing at 24.9-25.1k or place a tight stop there and let it run up to that bigger resistance region. Above that point, if you want to take a safer R:R longer-term play, ladder in shorts slowly up to 29.5-31.1k.The reason I am only analysing$BTCis because I think it is still the market leaders and alts will still correspond to$BTCprice movement. Will only touch alts at a larger area of interest, not in a low volume area. These are of course larger swing move plays and not meant for a day-trading style.Trade Crypto and FX with me here:https://www.xm.com/gw.php?gid=192102</content>

      <content>Crypto Update August 2022 (Part 2)Getting to my first region of 24.9k-25.1k, on longs right now you can consider running a tight stop loss after tomorrow to see if this region holds. I'd wait for tomorrow's reaction and the global markets to open. If we successfully break this region, I am of course looking at my next PoC at 29.5-31.1k where I will be flipping into shorts once again with some size. A lot of this move is fuelled by the lower than expected inflationary pressures that the Feds have "successfully" managed to curtail & contain. Wrote about this in the newsletter in the main channel!

      <content>For forex pair EUR/USD, price looks like it is finally coming back down into favourable demand zones after a huge spike up due to news in the US CPI.Thus, as the internal structure is still bullish, for now I would look to get in some quick buys from the areas marked out in tonight's chart markup.</content>

      <content>Been a boring past 2 days on EUR/USD where price is just trading sideways.But these are the points of interest i'll be looking for a good reaction off of & then scale in some trades from there.Point to note though, no matter what kind of market you trade in, its best to wait for a breakout on either side before you get in. Always wait for the big banks to show their hands first.</content>

Not fully loaded in as I was entertaining the smaller possibility of a move to 29.5k. But still in a good position here, just waiting it out.On the chart our ascending wedge just broke down. However, with no fuel to further push it down. I think we slow down here for awhile unless we get more FUD.</content>

      <content>29th August Crypto Update:Nothing much to update. i‚Äôm still in these shorts. As I said earlier on twitter, contingent on the inflation data and subsequent interest rate hike, I think we find a bottom in Crypto in the next year. I‚Äôll be short-biased till then. Looking at one last big drop till I look for longs again.I'm still scalping a small account but my larger portfolio is hedged in USD as well as put options. Another thing that i'll be looking into soon is gold. Like it or not, in a recessionary climate and with the US Public Debt, i'll still allocate some portion of my portfolio into Gold. Will do a video breaking down my portfolio arrangement soon.</content>

      <content>Forex EUR/USD updateSo an update, yesterday's trade was fully closed out at a total of +8.6% (20% runner closed out at 23RR).For now, the main target is still to break the low of 0.99 but the internal structure is kind of just trading sideways if we zoom out to see thus there isn't really any strong directional bias at the moment. So for today, would only entertain a quick short if my pattern drawn out, plays out.Trade Forex at XM with $50 bonus credit</content>

      <content>7 September Crypto UpdateI'm still on these 24.2k$BTCshorts! I'm trying to put out more opinions for alt coins and other stock counters out there but still quite limited with my time. I've always been saying i'll reassess in Q3 2022. Still looking at one more set of fresh lows before I think we potentially get a proper reversal to open up 2023.Sorry if this new trading style is a little slow, but we still have a 100% win rate on Crypto the last year with this method! Always remember that slow compounding is far superior and mentally sustainable as opposed to fast wins in the long run!</content>

      <content>Gold (XUA/USD) just broke the historical support level of 1680 late last week as predicted two weeks back.Will be interesting to see how things unfold on the chart after the news release on Fed's September interest rate hikes on Sep 21.The way the charts are lining up , I am inclined to think that Fed's may soon opt for 1/2 100 bps rate hike to tackle inflation more aggressively, and then we should see safe-haven assets like Gold start to climb back up after huge dumps during the rate hikes.Trade Gold CFDs</content>

      <content>Forex EUR/USD update:This afternoon, price broke the target low with a strong impulsive move to the downside, just like how we mapped it out yesterday night!Price is hovering around a critical support area now so won't be trading until we get a strong move away from here, especially with FOMC reports coming in at 2am tonight. My guess is that we'll turn bullish from here on for awhile though but its ok I'll just wait for more confirmation on where price wants to go before taking any new trades.</content>

      <content>For EUR/USD, the obvious trend is down now after last week‚Äôs FOMC but what we can look for right now is a complex pullback up into the 1.00 parity level (Also a nice confluence is the 62/70 fibs level at 1.00).From there, we‚Äôll see if price gives us a favourable reaction to continue our shorts.Trade EUR/USD here</content>

      <content>According to our plan to short from the supply zones drawn in our outlook today, a high probability short set-up was presented,taken and closed in 12minutes today.With this day trading strategy, we don't always have to be trading or looking at the charts. We wait patiently for price to give us a tell on which overall direction it wants to go first. Then draw our zones where we look for price to react from. Get confirmation on lower time frames using choch pattern. Then we enter trades and get out in a matter of minutes üëåTrade EUR/USD with XM</content>

      <content>Updated outlook on EUR/USD.Price wasn't able to get a strong enough reaction yesterday to continue down from my zones..but its ok we adjust and move on.Still, there were 2 valid quick scalps to get into from my zones if we traded this afternoon.. but the lesson/point that I want to share here is thatwe do not have to catch the full 100RR moves that we so often see on social media to be profitablein trading (especially day trading). In fact, a lot of profitable traders out there only try to catch a 1 to 5 RR trades & close their positions no matter how much further the trade could go in their favour.Find a consistent strategy that works for you, is profitable in the long run & stick to it!

      <content>EUR/USD was finally able to show some signs of strength & close above parity level of 1.00.Still, it will need to close above 1.02 to really turn to bullish sentiments. Till then, we are still macro bearish but looking at our daily outlook, longs are also valid too due to a strong bullish internal structure.Trade Forex here:XMMore from XM:Trade Ideas</content>

      <content>EUR/USDThe long setup wasn't there for us last week as it indeed rejected heavily from 0.995 area & now that there's a buildup of liquidity below, it seems that price is just waiting to dump heavily in the grand scheme of things. (Unless we close above 1.02)Still, Price is seeing bullish order flow again so I'll be looking to get into quick longs to 1.01 level for now.</content>

      <content>2 completely degenerate charts you can day trade if you want to make a quick buck.FTT & USDT/USD stablecoin pairings.What you would need for this. At this point, no TA needed. no FA needed. Just wait for the significant parties to tweet, or write a script if you have to, and trade based of that. Highly liquid, highly volatile, highly profitable, and also highly risky. One of the largest moves i've seen on a intrahour trade.</content>

      <content>9th November Crypto/Stocks Update:This is more of a post-mortem update. I am sure some of you guys might be affected by the markets and know someone who got hit as well. I have taken a small loss, albeit still sizeable as well. We move on.I do think there is still downside to this market on both stocks and crypto. Notable counters would be looking at the support at $130-150 for$TSLA, a quick wick under $10,000 for$BTCand under $800 for$ETHhave all been in consideration for me. I posted these thoughts on Twitter months ago if you want to go take a look. Best to be careful with your funds on CEXs for now, as the contagion and repercussions of the recent events unfold. A lot of this has to do with the 3AC implosion, causing Alameda, Genesis, Jump all to face insolvency and requiring bailouts causing the liquidity crisis in Crypto. For stocks, most earnings are dismal, we did see a run-up as expected into midterms. We only have a plausible Santa Claus rally coming but be cautious training into such headwinds. More details in my next video!</content>

      <content>A perfect long setup from our zone here in EUR/USD during the CPI release but trade wasn't taken as I typically avoid trading minutes before/after major news...Heading into Nov & Dec, Trading volumes/Price Action will typically be quite bad so high probability setups will be hard to come by but oh wells the goal is just not to give back all the pips we gained earlier in the year!Will post a simple breakdown in a bit of the setup tonight on the M1, using the CHoCH pattern.</content>

      <content>EUR/USD outlook for the week/in the medium term.With expectations that inflation has peaked, the Euro was able to finally break its previous macro high (& critical parity level) against the USD.Still, loads of liquidity lies below 1.00 & I wouldn't be surprised if price does a final trace back all the way down to 1.00 or 0.96 level again before continuing its supposed bull trend.Any buys right now would have to still involve conservative take profit levels.</content>

      <content>18th November Market Update:Some key price supports I am looking at; At the moment, we should expect a Santa Claus Rally or some stability in the markets this next month; I still think we resume the bearish downtrend in Q1 2023, I will ladder in long-term DTE bearish options strategy on$SPY, we're right at the resistance right now 4100 to 4200 is key (Video coming soon on this I promise). If you want to take a ride up, this santa claus rally,$ABNBis a possible opportunity right now at under $100. I see travel resuming, the property market cooling and the rental market to still be fluid and liquid. In terms of cashflow, I think they will still be a good investment as we make our way in 2023. Even if the general market goes up, I think$TSLAmight still go down in the short-term considering the shaky news there, along with a weakening TA indicators, either case, I think 115-145 presents a very good buying opportunity there if we get there. I'll ladder in on the day and update.For Crypto, I am still expecting a 8-10k$BTCtarget eventually but completely removing my exposure on  CEXs for the time being. I am shorting on XM (Link in Pinned Message) but a small amount only. My rationale is that opening derivatives on a non-crypto based company removes the risk of a bankrun or an exchange not honouring if Crypto does face insolvency or a liquidity crunch.This is my current take but it will evolve as we get to our next FOMC Hearing!</content>

      <content>20th November Market Update:So PPI data has just been released November 16, indicating a slower than expected producer price increase. We are starting to see inflation being controlled and rate hikes slowing down. All this in a positive earnings environment.We have also just seen a run-up to 4000+ on the SPY. Do we still have leg-room for more?I think yes. We remain in a relatively stable period this Q4 as we approach a prospective Santa Claus Rally.Are we still in a recessionary environment?Also yes, but it's largely been priced in and I think this next year is for buying. Perhaps not the S&P directly as we might revisit lows but I don't believe we go much deeper (At most 3300 range). Even them, there are several distressed assets already at multi technical lows worth considering soon;$TSLA$BTC$ABNB$GOOGL, yes even$META. There's not much more lower these can go and I think Q1 2023 is time to start laddering in. In the meantime, I will still taking shorter term trades.Sharing more on this here(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoohBPM4TM8&t)</content>

      <content>8th December 2022Current markets are indeed boring I must admit, but this place of ranging is quite a good place to practise some smaller day trading positions. Current PA for$SPYlooks like we rejected off the 4100 as I mentioned quite nicely. Have already flipped into some puts. For Crypto, we look to be developing a wedge on$BTC. You can play the resistance at 16800-16900 and the support at 16100-16300 for a few scalps I think the next couple of days. Also selling CFDs on SOL/USD.I have switched to XM on MT5 currently for my day trading account using CFDs (Essentially the same thing as Futures but i'll do a video on this soon).

I almost always only trade$BTCfor Crypto.Do note, this is my speculative account which I only started with 1000 USD in December after the FTX crash. Aiming to get this to 10000 USD in a month or so. No fixed timeline. Follow at your own risk. This account is for my degeneracy.I am also doing bear call spreads and perhaps credit spreads with my larger main account with options. I‚Äôll share on that later.Current Price targets for$BTC:Short-Term: 15.9k-16.3k SupportLong-Term: 8-12k SupportCurrent Price targets for$TSLA:Hoping to form a swing failure bottom and push for the $210 area. Tight trailing SL here. This could change with CPI Data as well as the FOMC hearing soon.</content>

      <content>Starting Balance 10/12: 1000 USDCurrent Balance 12/12: 2000~ USDClosed off yesterday's BTC Short from 17.2k for a nice profit ($528 USD, 1st Image). Currently on a long from 16.8k (2nd Image) as I expect a dead cat bounce once US Markets open just based on the SPY E-Minis having some upwards pressure.Actually closed open and closed these trades closer to the the top and bottom than it looks. Do note that the buy/sell spread is about 0.001%. Wasn't a perfect exit as I am still getting used to the spreads on CFDs.This might not sound great at first but with CFDs, I don't mind the wider spread cause there are zero commission and fees and markets are less wickish as compared to futures. Also I don't trust CEXs right now. I'll do an exchange/derivative comparison overview for my next video.</content>

      <content>Short-term target for$BTCstill think we need to tap and watch the 15.9k-16.3k Support. If that breaks, we go into goblin town. However, I don't expect the long term support at 8-12k to be reached so soon. Based on my extension models, I think more likely to be in Feb-June 2023. As of now, these are just good setups to swing trade.</content>

      <content>Pardon for the lack of updates recently here! But volumes are just so low in Dec that there's just not much high probability & high RR (risk-to-reward) trade setups, especially if you trade Futures.But here's anoutlook on EUR/USDwhere it looks like it may give a final tap at critical levels of 1.07 before going down for a pullback in this macro bullish leg.But at the end of the day, what we are all trading now really just depends on inflation and wage prints so take this opportunity when market is quiet to read up on these things!</content>

      <content>JUST IN TODAY: Consumer Price Index (CPI) Y/Y: 6.5% , accurate to analysts' expectations.As a result, we are seeing some bullish momentum in the markets right now but negligible as this CPI print may have already been priced in with all the bullish price action we have been seeing recently. (The only scenario the market was going down is if CPI came in higher than expected).Still, the markets have just been going up too heavily without any healthy pullbacks so i'm expecting the environment to turn bearish for awhile soon. Might be a good time to start hunting for short set-ups.</content>

      <content>Forex EUR/USD outlookI think everyone probably knows by now that Market is bullish. But as I've mentioned in the previous weeks, the bulls currently seems to be getting weaker & weaker, especially in EUR/USD. & there's just no nice levels to long from at the moment imo.So this might be a week where I start getting into counter-trend shorts (If there's strong confirmation) & potentially holding these positions for awhile, possibly catching the entire down move of a macro pullback, which has been long overdue. (But ofc, always take partial profits on the way down to secure some bread!)Trade Forex with me here:XM</content>

      <content>For EUR/USD, bulls are starting to show signs of exhaustion here, even with the favourable PCE news today.How do we tell? Traders can make use of candlestick patterns on the chart. For eg if we see multiple wicks beyond a certain point, it is an early sign of a possible reversal as the market isn't strong enough to push price impulsively to close beyond a certain level. (Of course, will still need other confluences to strengthen your bias)But anyways an update, in our selected zone on Jan 16th, 3 clean short setups were available (but weren't taken due to CNY events..)  Still macro bullish though, so taking partial profits/trailing SL is recommended for any counter trend shorts now.Trade Forex with me here:XM</content>

      <content>With all the momentum going up, will be switching my bias back to longs for EUR/USD & looking for price to revisit 1.08-1.09 areas to enter long to take out the target high.Some quick short setups were still available yesterday but would have got stopped out early if quick partials weren't taken (I got stopped out at BE too).

      <content>EUR/USD showing a strong bearish chain. Will look for a quick short from the latest supply zones should we get choch confirmation on the lower time frames / a sweep of liquidity then choch.I think we eventually hit 1.05 but the move down may not be so soon as we might also see a temporary relief up from this 0.79 level first.

      <content>US JAN. CORE PCE PRICE INDEX RISES 4.7% Y/Y; EST. 4.3%A lot to digest from but i'll try to break it down. Basically what this means is that we have to either keep rates sustained at 25 bps for longer (while implies prolonged pain & a slower drawdown). If we push up to 50 bps, this would be disastrous - when the rhetoric has now been to try keep at 25 bps and aim for a soft landing.My best bet is that it keeps the 25 bps hike but Powell suggests to raise the 2% inflation target & we just have to begin accepting higher prices and the destruction of our savings.</content>

(Or 1.062 is an ok level too to start taking final TP)But price action don't look the best atm - feels like may go lower to mitigate the re-entry zones.

      <content>Nothing too clean to look at for Forex atm so maybe just some quick thoughts on Crypto.Both BTC & ETH are struggling to close bullish above previous highs on the higher time frame charts & that tends to signify to me that bulls are either out of strength and we are ready to go down for awhile OR we are due for one final spike up to liquidate retail investors before a big dump.Atm 21.2k to 20.9k is critical for BTC to hold & ETH's is at 1.5k. Any lower, we can expect further dumps (Looking at 18.2k & 1350 respectively.)When will it happen?

      <content>Pardon my colloquial speaking, sharing this for learning purposes. Had a friend earlier ask me if it's still worth to short here. At the prices earlier today, I argued that it would be better off selling direct puts for$TSLAat 135-140. Of course, this depends on the time frame you are looking at. To have such sufficient premium, these credits have to be accrued over a much larger time frame. However, with FOMC coming up next week (May 2) I would either ladder in slowly, and stack there depending on the data.In other news, I will be doing some basic trading group lessons for free next month just to collect some testimonials but this will be limited slots for now due to my time constraints. (ps. I am also still learning as I go alongüôÇ)</content>

      <content>What is ADP and is it significant towards the upcoming Govt NFP data?Generally ADP is a smaller sample sized benchmark to the upcoming NFP data. Historically, ADP has come in lower 9/11 times compared to NFP. With this figure 142k about the forecast, this foreshadows another NFP beat. To put things rudimentarily, if the job market is still strong, this gives Powell leeway to hike once more into the FOMC, however I don't think it will be more than the 25 basis points into the 5.25 FFR forecasted tomorrow. Likely just a longer slower bleed, we will keep staying at this range till something breaks.</content>

      <content>How do we trade FOMC tomorrow?As always, the guidance is more important. If he pushes the rhethoric for longer sustained rates and opts to not pause (I think this possibly happens given the NFP data), we get a push down to low 400s on$SPYand heavier drawdowns on growth stocks. It's important to note tech, growth and banking sectors are not correlated. Higher rates might still be beneficial for bigger banks contingent if firesales and bailouts keep happening as we recently saw. Don't think crypto or gold crashes, floor is clearly established barring no black swan event.Still doing bullish spreads or outright spot holdings on Gold as I think we are in a ranging kangaroo market, no point going heavy leverage here.Also like bearish credit spreads on$QQQ, I think there's more premiums as compared to$SPY.Will live trade tomorrow.</content>

      <content>How do we approach CPI?CPI tomorrow should probably still read high, just like NFP. I still think we have a ways to go before interest rate hikes end. However, this doesn't make the idea of a soft landing impossible. So far, it looks like the FEDs are threading this fine line carefully and markets are holding up. Best way to take advantage of this with least stress is still credit spreads in this kangaroo market. Don't think equities go much much higher than this for now. Still at resistance and earnings are over so not much headwinds or big news barring a black swan event.</content>

      <content>Generally, I think a slightly lower than expected CPI number is mildly bullish for equities cause it implies a possible slowdown of rate hikes. However, the number is still too high. Today's movement should be faded back to pre-CPI levels, think$BTCpossibly retests down to 27.6k minimally then we watch that level. I still think Bitcoin and Gold will hold around these price levels. Good for scalps. If we get another chance at a 24-25k$BTCthat level is crucial,$XAUprobably holds steady here.</content>

      <content>Historically, I don't see BTC in the same vein as Gold, BTC is too volatile to be considered a safe haven asset, and it correlates very strongly with the indices. So Inflation up, Equities down, BTC down/muted, Gold up. With today's lower than expected inflation, Equities up, BTC up/muted, Gold down. As always, FED guidance is more important.

      <content>Why I still think credit spreads are good if you are aiming for a chill way to grow your portfolio. I think the rate that inflation is going down is still slow, given the geopolitical headwinds, and their lack of ability to provide stimulus anymore if the FEDs are aiming for a soft landing. It's unlikely we see significant volatile bullish momentum to the upside, If anything it's just a slow grind.Still same levels for$BTC&$SPY, looking at these 2 today.</content>

      <content>As you can see from my previous assessments above; we fade the FOMC day by going bearish neutral with credit spreads.

I don‚Äôt think they would want to spook the markets too much given how fragile the banking system is.Probably the same rhetoric that financial conditions are sufficiently tight, inflation is coming down, and they remain nimble.RSI on$QQQis above 70+ now,$VIXsuper low, and also$DXYand$SPY/$QQQare both trending up strongly.I think the play here is to wait for$XAU&$BTCto reach the support levels and place buys with SLs. You can also do a call ratio back spread on$VIXor$UVXYas insurance on the main portfolio since it is sufficiently low as well.Looking at1943 - 1935 for$XAU24.8k - 23.8k for$BTC15-14 for$VIXWider range because the ATR for these counters are pretty high, but the R:R for upside is definitely there!</content>

      <content>we are back down! if you are more risk averse, apply a back ratio call spread on$VIXor a mid-term bear call spread on$SPYis not the worst here.for the latter, i think something like buy call 440-445 & sell call 435-440 is a safe/conservative approach. for expirations, i would put them away from big news/earnings day cause you don't want the IV that comes with that.</content>

      <content>Still not much movement, the last time they had a debt ceiling stalemate iirc was in 2013, but the US has never defaulted on its' debt. It will be raised. However, the narrative they push with the FOMC minutes and PCE index on how they are tackling debt and inflation will be more telling on market direction. As of now, at least to me, equities are overbought and gold is oversold!</content>

I think if rates continue increasing, more banks will feel the heat. Bull run still not here imo, this is the year for spreads and a kangaroo market.Just as I assessed last week,I think$SPYat resistance already$XAUshould be performing up,$BTCshould be neutral as I am still not sure on it's rhethoric as a safe-haven asset.- I am still laddering more gold! - I am not touching$NVDA, or even$TSLAat the moment as earnings are today and I rather react! - For those copy trading my crypto positions (NFA DYOR), I am currently sized quite small as I am not sure how this API functions yet, apparently only allowed to do market orders which sucks.</content>

      <content>PCE inflation, the Fed's "preferred inflation gauge," RISES to 4.4%, above expectations of 3.9%. This is a major setback to the Fed's fight against inflation.A few weeks ago, no one was expecting further IR hikes but as we can see and as I mentioned, inflation is still sticky. I still think eventually there will be more rate hikes and a good correction to get in on stocks so not too worried at the moment. Still DCA-ing on my gold spreads!</content>

      <content>Just want to add that this is a tech rally spurred by a few big names: AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, which is why the tech index performed so well, a lot of other names are still down. This is really bad breadth. Additionally,$QQQis within 1% of its 61.8% fib (golden ratio) from Nov:21 top, $405, to Oct:22 bottom, $260.Why does this matter? The 2000 & 2008 bear markets rallies both stalled at their respective 61.8% fib retracements! ü§îA lot is based on the debt ceiling decision! There are still warning signs (sticky inflation, regional banking crises, consumer spending slowdown, credit card balance building, etc) despite this bullish rhetoric (AI).</content>

      <content>A writeup on the debt ceiling talks.Inflation is still high and will remain stickier if we raise the debt ceiling, however it is necessary to ensure the US functions.What I think will happenRepublicans & Democrats stall the decision to the last minute, eventually raising ceiling.Raising the ceiling has already been priced in so expect this to be a buy the rumour, sell the news situation. Just a quick dip then market resumes trend up slowly.On the small chance, they delay to the point ratings drop, expect a more significant drop. Recall 2011 (Image Attached) The greatest risk on US debt is not the Default, it has not happened before as they can keep shifting the goal post. The greatest risk is the debate taking too long and the credit rating go down.Eventually though, I expect subsequent FOMC rate hikes to dip the market a little, but the real damage is on small banks and mortgages - more defaults and bailouts would be the one that causes a more significant drop later on.</content>

      <content>Side Note: Not all of these are great R:R, I was just experimenting between Credit & Debit Spreads and trying to calculate the Greeks if the positions are worth it. I think$BTCis mid-term bullish, Equities$SPYshort-term bullish, next big date is probably FOMC.I am alsopurchasing some US bondsto try. You might be wondering, are bonds just for boomers? I don't believe so. I think having some cash equivalent is good in this market conditions as we're not going to hyper rally anyway given the yield curve is still inverted imo. We're not trying to make money off the yields but on the face value of the bond. I believe Bond Valuations are low and we are reaching a pause in hikes soon, with easing conditions, rates pause/drop, yields drop, bond prices will spike. Given I am not putting a 6 digit sum, and I don't think everyone has 6 digits to casually throw around, I am looking into bond funds (i.e. PIMCO, SEI, VWESX). Alsoincreasing exposure on my Chinese Equitiesslowly on another account! Still optimising my portfolio allocation and practising some QF.</content>

      <content>Likewise on$BTC, it is somewhat correlated to$SPY, it has a high correlation depending on the narrative. If it is a IR related news event or a M2 money supply related I think they correlate. However, if it relates to financial system breakdown there is some dissonance.If this does not make sense to you, it's okay. We bid 26.8 - 27.1k, next leg I believe is up. Even at absolute worst, there is support at 25k. I suggest not to be highly levered as the ATR on$BTCis huge.Both of these trades are quite speculative as we have no way of knowing when the debt ceiling will be signed. If you want a sure-er way of making money. Just sell cash covered puts for both or waiting for the supports to buy instead of trying to short.</content>

I also made additional profits from my$SPYcash covered puts not assigning, I generally put them below supports and I further try to time them by calculating daily ATR/IV to make sure they don't get assigned unless I really want them to.I did strikes 418, 415, 411 on 30/5, 31/5 and 02/6 respectively. First one has already expired without assigning and I re-opened 411 right after that closed. These are just meant to close my short and average to a better entry/hedge the position.Will be putting all my trades on excel and doing livestreams soon. Just relocating right now!

On my options account, I do debit/credit spreads,large swing plays ONLYas I cannot close in after hours such as now, however, since I benefit from decay I am not concerned with smaller swings outside of US hours. That being said Gold has a lot of movement even in London hours, rarely in Asian hours.For my CFD accountI do strict buy/sell as I am able to close at any time of the day.To put things simply: there is a core/satellite portfolio & we further subdivide according to derivatives and assets.- For Options (Swing Trading): WeBull/ToS/IBKR(Equities/GLD/Buy & Hold)https://www.webull.com.sg/i/sgseowie- For CFDs (Day Trading): XM(XAU Gold only, now exploring Silver/Soybeans/WTI)I don't bother with US500 here, no liquidity on non-US hours.www.xm.com/gw.php?gid=209620- For Crypto Futures: TooBit(BTC/ETH Futures only)https://www.xm.com/gw.php?gid=209620</content>

      <content>Support at1949-1951for$XAU. Close shorts flip into longs there. I normally close before the High Volume Node and wait for guppy/technicals flip. All fluid!London session will likely form a base support for gold. With US equities continuing to drawdown, I expect gold to relief back up in the US Session.

      <content>$SPYshorts & bear call spreads doing well. Okay in hindsight, the sell put 415 was quite dumb but considering all the CC puts I sold the last 3 days, I get 0.35 credit for it. If I am forced to close it and get assigned today, it does make me close at 415 - 0.35 = 414.65, which is also my TP area. So be it! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAs I said, I am still optimising my options strategy but I think my technicals and fundamentals for trading are decent already!</content>

      <content>Warning when trading news, if you do this - it is quite easy to trade if you can interpret the data fast; in terms of strength & subsequent move.Generally if you have access to Bloomberg terminal, you can assess news/data the second it comes out. The last prop firm and bank I worked at, I was able to take advantage of this. For retails, your next best bet would be to use Twitter/refresh forex factory.Faster data doesn't automatically mean better entry anyway; as market can wick both sides on the second news drops. You are generally 15-30s later on your own but still fast enough then most other retails imo.For instance, this debt ceiling move is very largely already priced in but I think dollar cools off here these next few days. I would not day trade this particular news. Also, asian hours now so it's weak!</content>

      <content>A lot of news this morning I need to update but I think these are important. The SEC is also re-defining the lines of their credit rating references. They've done this previously with inflation definitions ("changing calculations") and recession guidelines ("2 consecutive quarters"). What does this tell me?Either they are already poised for a downgrade given their irresponsible QE and debt ceiling upgrades and are front running the impact possibly.In addition, to CPI, FOMC, and the TGA refill draining liquidity. I might be wrong, but I still stand by my stance that it is risk-off for the markets here at least for the near-term.Source:SEC changes Credit Rating Terms</content>

      <content>One thing I am watching very closely is the XRP lawsuit. I think how it is defined as a security on the context of Howe's Law may allow crypto to run-up. This lawsuit will set the precedence for regulatory actions regarding crypto, allowing for a run-up after this drama subsides. I rather be reactive than predictive - most retail are too slow to catch the run-up anyway or too fast to catch the falling knife. Once news is out, I'll decide.Source:XRP Lawsuit</content>

      <content>Still holding on to$BNBshorts; I think one thing to note is that Binance holds 70-80% of circulating supply and they might need to dump some holdings to insure deposits.I am unsure how they operate but I am almost certain all Crypto Exchanges operate unscrupulously in some capacity, they are likely lending out your deposits in T-Bills/Collateralizing it in Stables. Floor can be deep on this so not taking profits yet, just trailing very distant stops. Can't hold this forever due to funding though...I'll make a bold claim and say Binance will not be allowed back into the US anymore and that absence of market liquidity coupled with their self-inflated price as they are the only MM will make it so we don't see ATH on this anymore.Join me trading at Toobit</content>

      <content>Inflation came out 4.0, 0.1 under expectations of 4.1. Still I think core inflation with housing & food is much stickier. These numbers to me don't mean much.Clearly analysts knew inflation would be coming down hence the run-up recently. Doesn't detract from the fact that the breadth of this market is still very very bad. I expect it to retrace still so holding on to my bear put spreads and selling calls on my portfolio positions - Won't be buying calls here. June to September are also historically bad months for equities/crypto.A likely pause this FOMC but still cautious of hawkish guidance from the FEDs as well as quadruple witching!

      <content>Fed's Powell:"We are watching CRE carefully... I do expect there will be losses in commercial real estate"I think conditions will not ease until 2024. This pause is just meant to aid the TGA liquidity dump and protect banks, it needs markets to run higher.The playbook for fomc meetings once again is to fade the initial news (unless unexpected) once powell speaks it reverses and then fade it again after it closes.Generally just a whipsaw and spike in volatility; which is why we long vega & do debit spreads or consider straddles.</content>

(If y'all recall I was posting 5-6 Digits Live PnL quite often then)12th December 2022I called to buy 16.3k and after the first impulse wave I targetted 25k, then adrawdown to 20kand themove to 30k.All tradeslogged here.Last Month, at 30k, I said to watch forsupportat 23-25k, we're here now!Only thing I can say now is that we truly go to shit, it is if Binance fails, Regulatory Blanket Bans, and/or Systemic Token Failure but doesn't change my long-term view of Crypto so i'll bid still at every support cause i'm laddering really slowly. I even said a year agoif we hit 8-12k it's in March - June 2023.(I think this is extremely unlikely) & time models are largely inaccurate (so should be taken with a pinch of salt). I think we get our rally in2025-2027, when conditions ease, so if that's your long-term timeframe, all good.All there, unedited if you scroll up.</content>

      <content>Many countries are now pausing, while China is full-on easing monetary conditions, I think this posits a strong possibility China markets run-up. The markets yesterday called Powell's bluff, historically (90% of the time, except 1981 with Paul Volker FED Chair) after it pauses it tends to remain paused. However, countries like the UK had to backpedal on this and hike rates in subsequent meetings.Personally, I still enjoy holding my holdings in SGD, cause we have gradual modest appreciation with our$SNEERlines. However, we can't appreciate too heavily or we will be uncompetitive with our exports.Source:China cuts rates.</content>

      <content>As you can see with the leverage, it went up 2x, and the average price went down. That's cause I added more on the dip.If you want to larp online as a FURU/GURU you can just take $100 put it on 125x Leverage, and this ROI will be 200%, don't get fooled by stupid ROI screenshots.

      <content>Gave the numbers more thana month ago! I called the bottom onGold (1935), Bitcoin (24.8), and VIX (14). All 3!The one thing I did not expect was$VIXto be so manipulated. Historically, VIX has been used by traders to hedge portfolio positions. This is my first time in my 7 years of trading (and apparently more) that VIX has gone down with SPY going up, and vice versa. I have a theory on this that this is due to the introduction of 0DTEs, which mess up the put call parity, as well as the volatility. Hence, making this run-up on equities both overextended and so beyond the Bollingers, and other extension models.Yes, you can argue with me "it's AI", I think this is purely manipulation where funds keep prices up while buying 0DTEs, crushing volatility while keeping up. It WILL eventually rug. However, I do not have information on what funds are doing, all I know is that when they pull the plug - it's gonna be a nasty drop.</content>

      <content>Quick assessment of markets;$BTCstill conservatively bullish here. I believe we range a bit so I am cutting my levered holdings due to funding and I am holding my spot.$QQQto me still topped out & overextended for this year & breadth is still horendous. I expect liquidity to drain from TGA and spread into smallers caps - looking at Dow Jones & Russell to reallocate my portfolio later on these few months. My long dated bear spreads are barely just positive already. Also why I chose to do bear spreads instead of direct puts if you saw above. This strategy alone saved my portfolio given how crazy this tech runup has been.$XAU, gold in mild bearish trend but I don't believe we break much lower,1800-1870is a huge demand zone and inflation is still high like it or not ‚úåüèº</content>

I still see gold at ATH by next year, but this is probably the slowest moving asset without leverage. As of now, I am accumulating both gold,  bitcoin and small cap etfs.Going to be a largely muted week with today being the US holiday.

      <content>While the US Debt Ratings Downgrade is concerning, other indicators are still pointing towards a strong economy. This weeks PMI and Jobs Report numbers will be indicative of that and slow down this drop in my opinion.However, we're coming into the weaker months of the year based on seasonality, I expect a short-lived downtrend the next couple of months.I believe tech ($TSLA,$NVDA) is grossly overvalued right now, but I don't want to short against irrationality. Hence, I will just be trading gold$XAUdown to 1905-1920. I believe crypto market cap in general will be muted and ranging, but alts will go down more, and I can see$ETHgoing down to 1720-1730 support.Trade on XM here for $500 Deposit Extra:XM National Day Promo</content>

      <content>Still in$BABAfrom $83 here - my largest holdings currently. Waiting for Thursday's earning to decide what I do with this. If we get a good report I will probably sell some more on the news. As usual, still selling covered calls.Markets are ranged bound recently which makes it better for long condor options strategy. I am still biased short on equities again but we have very weak data till Thursday so I expect a choppy muted week.</content>

      <content>As stated above, I gave my thesis as to why I saw dollar strengthening - allowing for a further sustained downtrend on equities and gold. Bitcoin still holding up relatively stable but I think we get a small drop there too. I believe this is a temporary dip only though. Will be looking into getting back in longs soon!Still looking at the same regions first.$XAU1905$TSLA220-225For Bitcoin if 29.1k does not hold, we are looking at possibly 26.4-26.6k, that would be a great region to re-enter long-term in my opinion. There is also a low-volume node below for gold so i'm waiting for guidance on dollar strength before executing.Trade on XM here for $500 Deposit Extra:XM August Promo</content>

      <content>1850-1890is a great point to start laddering into the$RUT(Russell 2000) for long-term investing. I believe the wider breadth might reduce your down-side risk.However, personally right now I am on a small short on equities but I am selling Cash-covered puts on$SPYfor $420-425 for about $2 credit for 15th September for the long-side. Not effectively delta neutral but decay is in my favour.Credit taking however is not exceptionally great here due to Implied Volatility not being high. Rudimentarily this means we're not in an exceptionally volatile environment, i.e. there is some market indecision. Hence, premiums and a credit-taking strategy is not exceptionally favourable here.Trade on XM here for $500 Deposit Extra:XM August Promo</content>

      <content>Gold$XAUlooks to be in a high time frame guppy flip already. I believe with the FEDs starting to posit for potential rate hikes. This is very bullish for the dollar. As such, logically equities and gold should fall. However, I think equities will be a bit stickier as we are indeed in a better economic macro environment.

As usual, as much as TA (Technical Analysis) can be predictive, we are still subservient and reliant to FA (Financial Analysis). In trading, you must be fluid and willing to change on a dime.

I will take a short hiatus to look to scale some of these up.In actuality, it is not just the ideas that makes the trade. Rather there is still execution, understanding of the different derivative platforms and knowing when to pull the trigger/cut the trade.

This should hold up for awhile.I still believe we get chop around this region till there is some guidance - especially with September Seasonality Lows.One thing to note is that the S&P has still incredibly narrow breadth, propped up by this AI rhetoric as Treasury yields drop on soft economic data, we are still IN a recession based off the yield curve but I think we can avoid a hard landing now.

      <content>Watch 1959 on$XAUGold & 29.1 - 29.4k on$BTC. Probably see some slow continuation here before we drop backdown - this is just a bearish retest. I don't see any more major move to the upside in the next 1-2 months frankly. Still think that last US Credit Ratings drop was a pivotal point that we are going into some hawkish/headwind months.The fact that jolts jobs data (lowest job opening since Sept 2021) and consumer confidence just fell so much implies that the economy is not that strong, you also have to consider the lag effect. Expect the usual red september.ü©∏I believe sometime next year is when you want to start loading up for the next bull run but no point rushing in now.Source:US Labor Markets Losing SteamTrade with me XM:https://www.xm.com/gw.php?gid=219919</content>

      <content>As I mentioned, I think the US Credit Ratings Drop, followed by the Jackson Hole speech is indicative of the short-term Hawkish environment. Cooling cursory inflation data negates the need for rate hikes, but this weakening jobs data could posit a 2nd round of hikes.Bitcoin & Gold are highly sensitive to rising US Interest Rates, the latter more specifically, as these increase the opportunity cost of holding - why speculate on gold when you can get safe and high return from higher yields from higher rates.These are very speculative. However, I can see$XAU, gold dropping slowly to at least 1850(Possible HTF Pennant). Similarly with$BTC, Bitcoin,a full extension drop will bring us to 23.9 - 21.2k(Possible HTF Swing Failure Bottom).I am cautiously bearish. With these, we also have to consider the contagion effect of the re-emerging Evergrande Crisis; accounting for 30% of Chinese GDP, a default would possibly require a Chinese Government Bailout.Source:China Evergrande Crisis Part 2</content>

      <content>Still bearish on$BTCand$XAU- as I said, just a bearish retest!That Bitcoin rejection was way faster than I thought, but I think gold's drop will be much slower. If we get to those levels - and you should be making money if you have been following - you should be buying back heavily with those profits. That's what I will be doing! Those levels are crucial to watch. For now, just holding shorts down.</content>

      <content>Just to be clear I think dollar strengthens since inflation is hot and we are going to get more rate hikes through till the end of the year.Funds should start going risk off as they repo their portfolio and take profits from all the tech gains (Just like Jensen Huang). Currently - BTC and Equities still bearish, Bullish gold in the short term.Long run, I think everything still goes up because the inflation machine is still strong and everything is going to be propped up.</content>

      <content>Gold ($XAU) likely see resistance at 1939 - 1941. This is a shorter-term view of the previous attached Gold Chart. I see support on$SPYat 440-441 respectively.Occasionally Gold and SPY will move inversely if it is a risk on/risk off scenario, but they can also move correspondingly if its a major dollar movement since it's the underlying currency they are both pegged too.  It's important to ignore the actual FOMC hike numbers unless they're out of expectations, as usual, the guidance will be more important, and i speculate that there will still be rate hikes proposed in November. Leaning on more upside for$XAUand slightly more downside for$SPY.(Trade with me here on XM)</content>

      <content>Doing the maths in Optimisation:With my initial 1400 shares of$SPYshort = 625k USD short. I held only 200 shares down till here. Closing all now in after markets! I should better optimise my strategy but profits and profits ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èIdeally, it was because I had different probabilities for each outcome and full extension while a possibility, was lower ,so I allocated a smaller % close here.

      <content>Defence Stocks in a New World OrderIf you scroll through my past postings, you guys will realise I have been an advocate for defence stocks likeLMTover the last 2 years. This is up 7% today and steadily rising since Covid.In Ray Dalio's Theories on the Changing World Theory - we often see that world powers dominance are in a cyclical nature. Hyperinflation, Dollar Milkshake Theory, Petrodollar all contribute to how the US weaponises their dollar. In short, it buys oil from the Saudi's essentially for free through incessant printing of USD. At the same time, supplying weapons to the Middle East & Ukraine, 'profiting' from conflict. Even when we eventually de-dollar, or any black swan events happens, one thing is for certain, the US will not go down without a fight.When Russia invaded Ukraine, the stock jumped ~30% in 3 days. Since the start of 2022,$LMTis up ~25% as geopolitical tensions have escalated globally.Trade with me on XM</content>

      <content>To Hike or not to hike?Currently, Markets are priced for no change in rates with the probability at 95%. Once again, the guidance thereafter is more important. I believe that the FEDs cannot afford to cut rates as inflation as I have said for the whole year - is too sticky and inaccurately reported. Housing prices still remain high, and this has long term ramifications on Population Data & Long Run Productivity.My rhetoric remains that we have higher for longer and they will only cut if the current rates break something (i.e Banking ystem, Mortgages, etc). I believe we still see another ersatz run-up on equities.TLDR: Given No Hike. Equities rally into the new year. With the possibility of hikes later on. Cuts only if system breaks.Source:FED holding rates at the highXM News Site:Learn on XM</content>

      <content>Still see upside on US equities as I believe dollar is to weaken and equities chop up towards the end of the year. I think over time the$QQQrally will slow down and disperse over to the$SPYand $RUT2000. A sustained rally requires breadth. Hence, still in all my positions. Only selling covered calls.This equities run-up in my opinion will come at the cost of the USD strength and$DXYseeing new lows as we see other countries dump more US Debt and Treasuries. Just to consider - we have a Santa Claus rally and have an election year coming up in 2024.This is supported by the recent statements by Dr. Ed Yardeni: ‚ÄúWe remain bullish on$SPX, which we expect will consolidate for a few more days before resuming the Santa Claus rally.We are still forecasting 4600 by year-end.

Watch NVIDIA's earnings especially closely tomorrow.

The bullish trend continues, with the D1 supply and 1.1000 level in sights.The data from Germany showed that the headline German IFO Business Climate Index improved to 87.3 in November from 86.9 in October. The Current Assessment Index edged higher to 89.4 from 89.2, while the Expectations Index rose to 85.2 from 84.8.Although these figures came in slightly below analysts' estimates, they had virtually no impact on the Euro's valuation. There are still lingering fears of a recession in the Euro zone but the bullish trend continues  for now.Trade with me on XM</content>

We are currently trading in the daily supply zone and we can only look for shorts once price shows bearish confirmations.Other than that longs are still in play, but I will only consider discount regions on the lower timeframes.On the fundamental side of things, the Fed's less hawkish stance continues to support EUR/USD. Fed Governor Christopher Waller mentioned that they may not maintain the high interest rates.Additionally, the decline in US Treasury yields cited as an additional weakening factor for USD.For EU, Spain and Germany are expected to report a slowing in the annual inflation rate.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR end-of-week analysisAs expected in our scenarios, price has continued to push lower after the daily supply mitigation, and has taken out one of the lows at 1.0852.There are 2 scenarios that we could see in the coming week.1st scenario: Price continues bearish, taking out the second key low at 1.0825 and fills the imbalance on the 4HR chart.2nd: scenario: Price retraces back into premium levels to fill the fair value gap above, before continuing the bearish pressure to the 4HR imbalance/demand zone below.On the fundamental side of things, easing inflation numbers fueled speculation that central banks will refrain from hiking rates further. The focus shifts to US NFP data next week.For the EU, the Euro weakened amid rumors suggesting the pause in Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) reinvestments leading to the end of the year due to low liquidity.Financial markets are pricing in a first ECB rate cut in April.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR analysisThe forecasted scenario played out, with price mitigating the 4HR imbalance. With NFP coming up, there are 2 possible scenarios for price.The first scenario, price continues the bearish trend into the 4HR demand. If this happens I will wait for lower time frame confirmations before taking longs.The second scenario, price retraces up into the 1HR supply zone which coincides with the higher timeframe equilibrium levels. From there we could look to take high probability shorts. to target the 4HR demand zone.Trade on XM</content>

Generally, we want unemployment to rise to cool off inflation. Equity markets reacted positively to this news and I am closing off my$SPYlongs VERY soon, we are getting to 460 now. Selling very tight calls, if I get assigned I will just close and buy back cheaper after CPI/FOMC next week!Not selling anymore of my$BTC.I generally only trade these 3 counters the most$SPY,$XAU,$BTCjust for convenience and familiarity. I still dabble in some currencies and alts.</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR analysisPrice continued to push lower after better than expected NFP and unemployment rate numbers. Price has yet to mitigate the 4HR demand, but I still expect the bearish pressure to continue.Next week's central bank interest rate decisions, CPI and PPI will determine the bias for the rest of the year.I still expect a retracement to the upside to sweep liquidity before continuing to the downside.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>4HR EUR/USD analysisWe have US CPI/PPI as well as interest rate decisions this week. For the EU we have ECB interest rate decisions as well. Expect huge volatility for the week. I still expect price to continue bearish into the 4HR demand at 1.0700.After the 4HR demand mitigation we have to wait for the release of the interest rates. Personally I feel that both the Fed and ECB will maintain their interest rates so it will be up to CPI/PPI data to be the catalyst for the rest of the week's movement.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR Weekly RecapThis week we had a ton of news, with US CPI inflation data at 3.1%, down 0.1% from 3.2% previously. PPI data didn't really affect the markets.US and ECB both released their interest rate decisions this week, with both central banks maintaining their interest rates at 5.5% and 4.5% respectively.On the technical side of things, The 4HR has shifted to bullish, and created a huge imbalance on the 4HR as well as leaving equal highs above to target.I will be waiting for the imbalance to be filled, before looking to continue the bullish continuation to target the weak highs at 1.1000Trade on XM</content>

      <content>Likely looking at a potential first meaningful pullback at (C) for$SPYfrom 475-485. Look for$SPYshorts here at break of previous SPY ATH. As Referenced fromSPY July 2023 Trading PlanWe got our A-B-C move, now we look for D. Have to still validate the Elliot Waves using Fibonacci Ratios and Stochastic Oscillators.Wave 2 and Wave 4 will alternate. If wave 2 is a sharp correction, Wave 4 is a flat correction and vice versa. Since we got a relatively sharp correction for Wave 2, I presume this will be a flatter one.</content>

We have also have liquidity building for future shorts. The 4HR imbalance from last week has yet to be filled. Volume was much lower compared to last week.FundamentalsMost of the volume this week came in after US GDP and unemployment claims came out on Thursday, followed my US Core PCE inflation data on Friday.

Currently we have 2 scenarios for the end of this month.The first scenario is that price mitigates the  4HR demand in discount (1.0800) levels. I would look for longs in this area to target the supply zone above at (1.088-1.090)Second scenario is that if price retraces into the supply zone at premium levels, I would look for shorts to target the 4HR demand.Taking any trades within this range would be low probability.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>Waiting for the pull-back to D for$SPYapproximately at 450-460. Starting 1st layer of re-entry at under 460. Should not be that deep of a retracement given fibo/elliot wave models.I do believe we get a melt-up if the FEDs follow through with their rate cuts. However, with regional banks starting to close again ($NYCB) along with BTFP ending in March, I expect the delays in cuts from Powell's more hawkish stance in yesterday's FOMC to pull this market back into consolidation; as I mentioned inflation is not that easily beaten and he is not willing to pivot so early.If we recall from the 1970s-1980s, Volcker did face a 2nd rise in inflation.

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR end-of week recapPrice has been ranging at the start of this week and became more volatile towards NFP. Yesterday's news gave us a huge 4HR imbalance to fill next week.I expect 2 scenarios early on for next week. First scenario is that price retraces up to fill the 4HR imbalance at around 1.085, before continuing the overall bearish trend.The second scenario is that price continues to be bearish and closes below the 4HR demand without mitigating the 4HR imbalance.Imo taking shorts after price fills the 4HR imbalance at premium levels would be higher probability. Monday's Powell speech and ISM services data will give us the bias for the week.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>I am still waiting for$SPYto retrace. Given the delays in rate cuts. March cuts are very unlikely. May might not even be in play. As I mentioned multiple times previously, I expected delays in the cuts. This temporal strength in DXY and the dollar should induce weakness in equities as money market funds remain attractive.</content>

      <content>In China Markets; Still heavy in$BABA$KWEB$CWEB$HSI$PDD. I see more upside with China after Xi's announcement now. I have covered calls as I mentioned to hedge. Those following my Twitter would know I have been loading up!$NIOalso cheap here but high risk.US Market is now pricing in 4 rate cuts instead of 6. As I mentioned previously, I expected delays in easing conditions and a second rise in sticky inflations. This will be a real stress test for regional banks$KREand geopolitical risks will affect defence stocks$LMT.Re-bought my Crypto early and just holding. Think we get bull run for both gold and crypto in 2025 when dollar collapses when and if they have to bailout banks.All subject to change.</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR Analysisprice is currently retracing to the upside since last week. We had a 4HR imbalance from NFP that has yet to be filled. As of now the higher timeframe bias is still bearish.2 scenarios for me. First is that price retraces into the 4HR imbalance, gives lower timeframe confirmations to the downside and we take shorts.Second scenario is that price continues to push lower and closes below the 1.072 region. If that happens, we can continue to take shorts. My bias will be bullish if price closes above the 4HR imbalance.Trade on XM</content>

We have a 4HR supply caused from Tuesday's US CPI data coming in better than expected.Currently we are in a bullish retracement phase into premium prices. The most likely scenario is price to mitigate the 4HR supply, where we can look for potential shorts to continue the bearish trend.My bias will only be bullish if price closes above the 4HR supply zone.On the lower timeframes I would look for longs to the 4HR supply in premium prices.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>I am beginning to realise we are not going to get a wave down on$SPYfor D. However, if we run straight to E at 525-535, I would honestly be extremely concerned because this smells like manipulation, driven by derivatives, 0DTEs & not a healthy stock market upward movement.It would very likely be a blowoff top with$NVDAin this case likely being 1200-1400 at maximum. Without a pull-back this is actually likely going to be a spectacular liquidation cascade crash downwards after. This would also mean the dollar devalues hard & bonds are dumped.I got stopped out of my US Equities$SPYshort from 502 at small profit & still in my Crypto$BTCshort collecting funding with a SL at BE as well now, same targets.</content>

As much as FTX has failed me, the FTX UI allowed for greater functionality and creative trading with options and OCO GTC FOK orders.

      <content>Think we potentially get a sweep to 496 and then a final blow off rally at 425 on$SPYbefore a major correction. But the risk:reward on upside is not great on tech at the moment. Looking at bear credit spreads potentially on$NVDAlater as we have reached our 2.618 extension now. Very risky play but I will limit risks with options.Yesterday's FED speech shows a lot of mispricing in the markets:1. S&P 500 is trading like are in a new bull market carried by tech / Regional bank stocks are crashing like the crisis never ended.2. Bonds are rising and dollar is dropping like the Fed is cutting interest rates. / Inflation data is rising like rate cuts are cancelled.3. Bitcoin¬†is rising like there's no recession coming / Gold is rising like a recession is on the way.</content>

      <content>I am looking at 1.2k at the top-end target for$NVDA; that should bring the final$SPYtarget at 525-529 for the full wave I drew since June 2023. The longer it doesn't correct, the more convinced I am we get a strong pullback there. For the time being, rally is strong so I am selling cash-secured puts and holding stocks but rebalancing and selling covered calls.As per Powell's Speech, rates are definitively going to be high for longer but with backdoor easing through the reverse repo market & tga.</content>

      <content>$DXYdropped almost half a percent just today alone. That's huge for currency. If you want to reposition your portfolio into a more stable bet I actually think gold has plenty of upside towards 3k. We have finally broken through the range and trending strongly above the 200 MA. China stocks are also still undervalued but in a bear tightening channel/wedge.The worse thing you can do imo is hold cash given rising inflation and a federal reserve that is more concerned for the elections and buying votes.</content>

      <content>Daylight Savings eastern time will revert back to NY open at 9:30pm Singapore GMT+8 time.Powell's closing remarks which I must highlight is that he sees more banks failing and rate cuts at the end of the year. I am sure policy makers and banking institutions are pressuring him to lower rates at the cost of a devaluing USD.I am almost certain we get fresh lows on the dollar and 5200 on$ES$SPYfor our final wave which means we get a $1000+$NVDA. My gut says we pivot reversal there. I have been correct on a lot of the larger moves over the years if you scroll through the pinned messages.</content>

      <content>I still see China as undervalued and US as overvalued. Just a possibility is that we get a diverging wedge into a final rally into the end of the year before a major market crash in 2025 after the election year. I think it's entirely a possibility that we get a 2nd run of inflation given this equities rally and the persistent CPI as seen by today.February CPI inflation rate RISES to 3.2%, above expectations of 3.1%.Core CPI inflation fell to 3.8%, ABOVE expectations of 3.7%.This is the 35th consecutive month with inflation above 3% and second straight increase.A Fed pivot is becoming less likely.Once again, I do not recommend trading like me as I am a degenerate and I am just giving my 2 cents.</content>

      <content>Might be crazy but I can see us trending down to 511.23-512.11 to fill the gap on$SPYvery soon. This PPI is the hottest since June 2022. Generally for the last 2 times at least - CPI causes a run-up and then it fades into a dump on PPI. We normally see bullishness on Fridays which tend to be low volatility, that's why we call it VIX crush friday.However, this Friday is slightly special because we have Triple-witching and OPEX tomorrow, coming into it with low volatility. Hence, I think Volatility/Vega spike into it and that tends to be to the downside.$BTCbeing a risk-on asset should also follow and our dollar strength gets a relief rally up. Long-term trend still up as long as we maintain the levels.</content>

      <content>Not longing$BTChere as trend has clearly changed bearish on the guppy. Only yesterdays bounce was worth a long as there were still delulu bulls buying the dip. Psychology says they're now a bit scared! R:R to 55k should mean this trade should be low leveraged! Don't get emotional üëçüèª</content>

      <content>Looks like no bounce for$BTCin the London Session and US Pre-Market with the new daily savings hours. I will still short on the US Open since I closed around here anyway. I expected the killzone between sessions to have a short pullback on the dollar but looks like guess not. Anything above 69.2k I am shorting.</content>

      <content>This is called a Guppy Flip (GMMA).  Similar to a MA crossover/golden cross - it is bearish when the short-term Moving Average bands crosses the longer-term ones. I set this up on Pinescript on TradingView! (For your learning) When confluenced with the Elders Force Index - it can be predicative of a trend change. Will share my excel trade log here for free soon too! Going to be doing Youtube soon.</content>

      <content>$BTCOversold on a short-term basis. Too late to short here based on R:R. Will bounce soon under 66.5k. In order to not spam, I will shift to discord eventually. Rarely markets run this hot. Traders love volatility!</content>

      <content>Red region main resistance area! Patience on looking to short. You'll end up shorting the bottom. 512.44-12.71 for$SPYon the gap fill. 69.1-69.7k for$BTC. Around those regions! I can enter earlier personally because I am using profits and flips to buffer. Trend clearly down for a few weeks to a month until FOMC. I mentioned this multiple time above.</content>

      <content>Trying to be patient with the setups. Sometimes I close earlier out of principle. Such as closing the$BTCBitcoin short at 68.3 and then the flip long from 66.1k earlier at 68.3k, even though I expect it to wick to 69-70k.This applies the same for my$SPYshort, I closed at 509.85 from 518 instead of waiting for 507/508 even though my support levels are there. Currently in$SPYlong from 508.5 targeting 511.9.While the idea would be to maximise profits, I believe in taking profits at a higher probabilistic area and ladder in the flip slightly more extended.</content>

      <content>Patience... told ya! I could hold my longs longer. But being disciplined! We don't miss üéØ Going to be also cautious about overtrading now. I have never took so many trades in a week... Might take longer timeframes instead to catch a break. Once again, pretty damn good snipes!Gave 66.1k$BTCto 69.7kGave 508.5$SPYto 511.9It's not just the winrate. The accuracy has been pretty onpoint barely a few pips off last 20-30 trades.</content>

      <content>Clean so far! Calm ‚úåüèº On a roll!Awake at the most ungodly hours with little sleep.Choosing to lower leverage and take a bigger move now to 50k potentially. Once again, I know it may sound absurd.  That's what people said the first time I targeted 18k from 69k in 2022 when I targeted 69k from 22k. (Check pinned messages.) However, I have done this many times before.We trade probabilities not possibilities.</content>

      <content>There will probably be a bounce at 61k, but I believe 46-49k will be the larger point of control/high volume node. Whether you choose to TP early or not and re-short depends on leverage. Like I said earlier, I want to hold this down.Can I close my shorts at support and reshort? Yes.Is it worth my time? No.</content>

      <content>People always tell me$BTCBitcoin is  a store of value - it's not. No store of value would have this kind of volatility. I have ran through large datasets on bloomberg terminal before. It's a risk asset for now plain and simple. It can change over time with halvenings and less supply would likely cause less volatility over time. By then, your chance to make life-changing money would be gone, we ride the waves of speculation and volatility till I think 2030s.</content>
