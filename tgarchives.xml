      <content>21th JanLong 37.8 to 38.5 regionStart closing at Resistance- 39.2-39.2 (1st TP) 40% CloseRemainder 60% put with a trailing stop loss as we attempt to run up to the lower probability (2nd TP)- 40.7-40.9 (2nd TP) 40% CloseLast TP for all would be 46/47k and 53/55kTo me (1st TP) is a very high probabilistic play. I am not touching much alts at the moment, but that‚Äôs because considering my size isn‚Äôt small, i will have to deal with too much slippage issues. Will advise differently for smaller portfolios. Alternatively ETH can also be done with this ranges. Will update on Stocks & Commodities later!</content>

      <content>Taking some profits at 39.1 - 39.3 region as I stated. Will teach you guys how to ladder out exits as well. Then change to a trailing stop loss to de-risk. Depending on how you guys like to trade - for me, I honestly only touch my positions once every 1-2 weeks. But during that few hours period I tend to be a little more active (like now) to protect my positions/entries.</content>

      <content>(Crypto) How I am managing this range is basically using my previous profits I took at 39.2 from 38.4 as a buffer for current positions. Still in some longs with a trailing stop loss. Will come up with some Udemy materials and guides soon! Was very patient waiting for this 38k region and that's how you should be in these markets ü§ôüèª Bigger resistance range is still as mentioned at the 40.7 - 40.9k region, got some serious liquidity to tap there.</content>

      <content>Like I said on 17th December above, if you are into NFT/Gaming Coins I think they have no value fundamentally. Coins like$DAR,$AXSwill crash very very heavily. These have dropped 60-80% from ATH but BTC is only on a 50% drop. This is the reason I only buy$BTC,$ETH, or L1 coins if I am doing value investing. If you want to buy the dip, buy fundamental stuff. A lot of things will die with this pullback.</content>

      <content>I would say to stay calm at these prices, I don't think we go to 20s, I think we hold here in the 30s for awhile before we get a relief short squeeze back to 37.8k - 38.8k (this might be a chance to exit or take profits), after that bounce we have to reassess if back in a bull market or consider the global situation to see if we enter a recession/hard correction. Funding is negative which is rare for most markets as it's normally a buyers market. Crypto/Stocks movements now actually rely heavily on the Russia Situation, Interest Rate Policies I believe.</content>

      <content>Holding my Crypto Positions, got some$SOL,$FTTon that dip, as well as still in long.$CLOVi am still laddering in, very very slowly around $2.5-$2.6, floor can be deep on this one! My rationale for stocks are to take a much longer swing as opposed to Crypto. Normally for Crypto I am more of a swing trader as I think the markets are much more volatile, you have to get in and out fast. For Stocks, I can normally do 3-5 months even to let my idea play out.</content>

      <content>if this doesn't hold, it could just range within this region, which is also something i'm expecting. but in general this is a very speculative style of trading doing daily candles. if you're doing a wider swing play lets say weekly/monthly, i think buying here for a longer term hold for a more chill, wider region play isn't bad either.^ not sure if this makes sense. will explain it in a future video.</content>

      <content>If you entered the 35.1, watch the 35.5-35.6 region if we hold there or reject, this is another decent entry i believe but just be cautious with your stop loss. i generally don't day trade much tbh. just that after yesterday's big drop it's lucrative to play these ranges.

      <content>Think we are range bound here for awhile. Would not be taking shorts at these prices. It's basically long C with tight stop aim for range high at D to go for a short and place a stop. Do this 1-2 swings and get out if you are day/swing trading. You can only do this after a big movement and only for your first 2-3 swings. I would probably stop around Wednesday. Fridays tend to more volatile. My Bias now is long cause R:R for shorting simply isn't good...I think we should still relief to 37.7k eventually, just be slow to ladder in positions you should be fine üëçüèº</content>

      <content>I suggest to derisk at the 37.5-38.1 region, that's what i'm doing with my positions. This is a resistance area... Hopefully you guys entered with me at 33.3k. I only managed to get in at 33.8k but that's cause with a larger size I face slippage issues so I can't snipe as well...</content>

      <content>Quite interesting; I always notice this trend, I'll scour other exchanges or new options bids to confluence my ideas. Interesting how this squeeze on Bitstamp predated the movement on every other exchange subsequently that there would be a short squeeze.This has actually happened many times before. Bitcoin actually went to 8k a couple months back on a flash crash long squeeze on Binance US, that move also made me cautious and gave me confluence into predicting 66k was the top!</content>

      <content>already had my idea on this region 2 days back as you can see. but i tend to watch OI, liquidations and options ticker to find where to long exactly. 33.3k just felt like max pain to me. most people expect a swing failure bottom and the low to not break past previous lows which is exactly the reason why it needs to do that, to bait breakout traders and then trap them to provide liquidity for impetus to push the subsequent run-up. on the opposite end, it did this at the top too, went to highs of 65k, drop, rise back to 69k and bait the most amount of breakout bullish investors, and then reject so harshly to 33k, trapping them indefinitely. its beautiful to see üòÇ</content>

      <content>think we double test the top region above 37k, watch that carefully, put a trailing SL, if you haven't got out, consider getting out later but potentially we might squeeze higher as well. i'm not shorting only looking for relongs with SL.</content>

      <content>Next resistance for BTC would be 41.2 - 41.5, I would not mind gandering a small short there *if we get there* FOMC hearing this week, Powell discussing 4 interest rates hike this year, ideally means we still see 2022 as a very bad year for investing.

      <content>If you closed some where I suggested at 36.6, this region is a possible reshort at 38-38.2k. Alternatively, if you are low leveraged, just hold it and ignore this (PA) Price Action.Still think we range and downtrend is still intact. Macro view remains unchanged. These areas are where I would be less speculative. I always expected a bounce at the end of January cause of the Tax Harvesting wash trade rule ending (mentioned this a couple of times). Nothing unexpected so far, other stocks will also relief.$TSLAat under $800 will have a relief bounce as well!</content>

      <content>For$BTC, Still at resistance but market hasn't move much at all. Would be more cautious when it consolidates so long, probably means continuation and that we need to tap a higher liquidity before we go down again. Would deleverage or cut my shorts if we stay here any longer. No trade zone till February I think. Watch the monthly close and check the tax harvesting rebuys today. We'll move soon!</content>

      <content>Current Price (38975) this area is a pretty good region for a 1st short (38.9k) but bear in mind we can still go to (40.6k). How I would do it is to do a super tiny entry at the area for the 1st region and a more sizeable one at the 2nd region. Then watch the 40.6 area with alerts. This region is where I'd expect a rejection... and a reversal on the higher time frames if it's supposed to happen.</content>

      <content>just to be clear, most times when i take a position, i give room for error for it to go to my next region. what this means is don't go all-in on your short at 38.9k with your stop loss or liquidation at 40.6k, i always give allowance just in case we go to the 2nd region, unlikely but always plausible. basically, take a short, not large, but enough to make some profits. i generally just keep doing this and compounding profits.</content>

      <content>($BTC) Strict Invalidation at the 41.8k region. Weekends normally trap longs!A bit early on the short but I think we still retest supports:40.4k-40.6k (Weak)(80% Probability)39.5-39.8k (Weak) (Might not close here, just trailing SL to let it run deeper)37.8-38.5k (Strong) (40% probability)Should be flipping longs at the 37-38k region if we get there! Expecting a bounce if we get there! However as always, if we do breach 41k I will cut my positions, this is the last stand for this high volume node. watch this region very very closely if we do need to cut. my gut would be just to ladder in shorts slowly and use miniscule leverage. i generally keep shorts leverage much smaller than for longs.</content>

      <content>The 41k region is a key resistance after all... Depending on whether this holds, I would suggest the next strong resistance to be 46.5 - 46.9. I would cut the short if we breach previous highs again. Otherwise, think we sweep lows once again. As always, trade safely and not with high leverage, this is not a great region. Don't fancy it too much... Perhaps looking into some US Stocks/Forex might be better. Shorting is generally not advised when we already dropped so much...</content>

      <content>(Crypto) Had to cut most of the positions at 41k cause we consolidated for too long... (Thankfully wasn't leveraged) Will just aim for the next resistance. The next real resistance would be 46.5-46.9k. Opting to sit out till then cause I am not convinced we fully broke this region yet. Just a feeling...Basically: Closed off all my earlier longs from 34/35k at 41.5k fully already just looking for shorts now but being patient and slow with it.(US Stocks) Only holding$ABNBpositions, exiting slowly. Aiming for 164 but exiting on my way up. Options expiring in 3 months. Took profits fully on$CLOVas I mentioned already!</content>

      <content>As mentioned earlier here, held my 34.3k longs to the resistance regions but the attempts to flip short I've had to cut. It's a good thing we rode the large longs up but had to give back some profits to the market from the shorts. It's part of trading I guess!Depending on the conviction you should opt for different sizing. General rule of thumb is to always go less size on shorts cause it's just generally a poorer alternative.I normally opt for 1-3x Leverage for Longs & 0.5-1.5x Leverage for Shorts. This would ultimately depend on your own account size as well.On a 2x Leverage long, it requires a 50% drop to liquidate you.On a 2x Leverage short, it requires a 100% gain to liquidate you.Even above that, since you're normally DCA-ing your entries, we essentially have no chance of liquidations unless we have black-swan flash crash events. However, in view of such lowered leverages. Most ideas & positions I hold out for 1-2 weeks normally.Hope that makes sense!</content>

      <content>(Crypto) Looking at 46.5k-46.9k for the next resistance now, good cut on the previous short. Holding Spot Longs, just going to ride this up and exit as soon as we reach resistance, orders already set üëåüèº Could opt for alts in this time too, if you prefer more ROI.

      <content>(Crypto) Still in our low volume node, think we can ride this a little further, especially on alts as well. We should see 45k holding today. However, given the speed of the movement up, I think we reject quite hard on resistance. Best to put orders well in advance to take profits, DCA up all the way to around the 46.5-46.9 region!(US Stocks) Still in$ABNB. Still patient. Waiting for$TSLAas well!</content>

      <content>(Crypto) Think we are in a resistance area; idea is to DCA your exits otw up as I mentioned. Just ladder exits and put a trailing stop loss if you're gonna exit soon. (That's the best way I found) Pretty difficult to time this exactly... Crypto really moves so much faster compared to stocks. This trading style might not be for everybody.. Hope everyone got out!

      <content>Didn't exactly hit 46.5k, we only went up to 46050. That's kind of what happens when you try to time it too exactly. Fortunately we at least took the longs up to there.

      <content>Hi guys! Just a weekend update. Think overall trend is still down, max we can possibly see for a resistance would be 43.3-43.8k. With the CPI data, I am expecting more downside with Crypto. Same story for stocks, I think$ABNB&$TSLAare still good for sells or puts. With current market conditions I am just not keen on buying for long term holds or value investing. Value investing would imply I have to see value at these prices and I think further downside should not be ruled out!</content>

      <content>(Crypto) Entirety of this red region 44-46k is great for shorting on the larger time frame; i'm talking on a weekly candle basis... Just don't overleverage, you should be fine. If you entered earlier, i'll just lower the margin size when I reach breakeven, we should retrace back down to low 43s at least so you can definitely get some positions out and re-short again higher. These are not regions i'll be taking longs or being bullish already. Short R:R is better.</content>

      <content>(Short Guide on Crypto Futures)What I mean by this is that I am gonna ladder in shorts slowly but I expect a sweep of the lows eventually on the larger time frames so as long as you can hold down the position, I think long run it's okay. Besides funding pays shorters right now so you are paid to open shorts. Like I mentioned previously, my shorts I tend to use 0.5 - 1x Leverage, longs I use 0.5-2x Leverage for Crypto. (This is for me personally). This style is a much more slower, passive way towards trading; position trading. Just laddering in entries much slower for larger swings...i.e. if using a 1k account$200 at 44.8k short$200 at 46.5k short$200 at 46.9k shortThis employs $600/$1000 (60% Margin used) (0.6x Leverage) Which would put liquidation at 76.3k for your short contracts to liquidate you. Also makes your average entry around 45-46k overall; which is the end goal objective. If we break this region then i'll consider cutting losses. If eventually we take profit at range lows of 38k. That would still net a 21% gain off $600 which would be $126. That's a 12.6% off your $1000 Capital.I prefer to do this style as it's just overall less stress with lower leverage and in this choppy/rangy market. Accumulating 10-15% each month can still be a decent amount long term!Just teaching you guys how to ladder in positions. I think at the end of the day, patience overall makes all the difference.</content>

      <content>For Options, currently using Deribit for Crypto but I mostly use options for US Stocks.Looking for CLOV re-buys on 1-3 month call options at around $2.35. Probably fairly deep ITM. Still on$TSLAputs and waiting for$ABNBto retrace since I exited my previous calls from $140 at $163! Not really worried of the market running away from me in this macro market conditions.

      <content>Also hope you guys cut your margin just now. 43.8 just wasn't a good initial entry but we did revisit it just now a 2nd time. Will look for 46.9 as a very very strong resistance. I've mentioned this number a couple of times earlier.I'll be waiting for 46.6-47.1k and otherwise I am just holding a small amount of shorts all the way up just in case we just go down. Nothing too significant. less than 0.2x Leverage. Obviously you could also long to 46k, but I just don't like the R:R of longing at this point already, won't be able to sleep at night... That's all the updates for Crypto till we reach my key regions.</content>

      <content>18th February Update:Summary on my own Trades$ROKUwent up another 5% from 168 but got rejected hard off the 9 day MA and 0.236. Entered at 141 but took profits quick on the rejection closing at 168-170. As I mentioned above, I am pretty quick to take profits on my longs in this market, which also makes me lose out on some potential gains but that's the nature of the market, I abide by the trend...Entered$ABNBat 140 and sold off at 163 so missed out the move from 163 to 190. But it‚Äôs also hard to time a perfect time if there are short squeezes. Not gonna beat myself up too much, profits are profits. I am not a perfectionist..Entered$BTCat 34k sold 41k, missed the move up after that but took the short from 43.8k to here, so I think that makes up for the mistimed long close‚Ä¶ Still in shorts but watching!Only one down a tiny bit for me is$FDXbought at 227/228, now trading at 226. Probably going to take the loss. But 0.5% loss on 1 trade, couldn‚Äôt care less since the rest made much more.</content>

      <content>18th February Update(Crypto)Possible Theory I drew out a couple days back for$BTCas you can see from this chart it hasn‚Äôt fallen yet. Looking for 38.6-37.8k for a 80% close on my short positions from 43.8k. Then I‚Äôll look for a bounce at D to consider a re-short with a trailing SL. The take profit after that will be determined by Fundamental Analysis news, so I can‚Äôt picture it right now‚Ä¶ Obviously still a long shot but I do like taking the larger swings as opposed to smaller ones which is why you can tell I mentioned I generally hold my positions for 1-2 weeks on low leverage and I just keep adding size till my bias is correct, this works if you are disciplined!</content>

      <content>(Crypto) I generally look a Crypto once every week or 2 weeks. Trying to take the longer swings so don't expect me to give updates daily. I generally don't have the time for that either. This style works for my time schedule and outside commitments.(US Stocks) Took a small L on$FDX, like 0.5%, closed$ROKUin profit very hastily and fortunately, closed all the rest in profits for$ABNB. Just holding my$TSLAput down and paying attention to Lockheed Martin$LMT. That's all for today I suppose!</content>

      <content>Only expecting a small bounce here, generally already short biased because I have a OTM put option! But this is very speculative. I basically took a small small OTM put at 44.3k along with my initial shorts but it's more like a wager betting on 20ks eventually. This is more like a gamble but a calculated one!

      <content>21th February Update:(Crypto)Expecting a small bounce for$BTCto the 38.6-38.8k region from here (38.3k) at least and 39.5 at most (Even if we get here, I don't think we hold there for long, so I'm not gonna bother longing here). Clear downtrending pattern already. Think we can expect continuation. Still short-biased, rips are for shorting. I am still 60% closed so not re-shorting; just looking to time my short closes, and potentially re-short higher. It's a good rule of thumb of mine to just simply not short as it goes down. I prefer to ride with my current position as opposed to exposing myself to more margin risk. Generally, you can also short alts but I think that really depends on your contract size or if the alts can support your liquidity. I don't tend to do that cause alts have more volatility and might not have enough liquidity to support my size.(US Stocks)Why I say Lockheed Martin$LMTis because it's a defense stock that is tied in very closely with defense budget of the US and is mainly funded by that. Threats of war will of course highly correlate with this stock's prices. I'll do a video/newsletter on this. In short, the U.S. government has agreed to take delivery of 133-139 aircraft and 151-153 F-35 aircraft in 2022 and 2023. While we can expect the FEDs to cut spending, I don't think this will be in the form of defence budgets tightening as with a volatile economic/political climate, I would expect Defence to be of higher precedence even...</content>

Closed 60% of my shorts already at C from B (average close of 38.2), not longing from C to D due to poor R:R, just laddering in re-shorts of the same size of 60% at D (38.6-38.8k 30/60%) and (39.5-39.8k 30/60%). Something like this. Hope this makes sense! Update again soon.(US Stocks)Stacking up on$LMTslowly but it already did a run-up. I've been stacking for a year now. It's just a more stable defence stock. Also waiting for my$TSLAclose at under $800, potentially $750.As always, NFA and DYOR ü§ôüèª</content>

      <content>21st February Update:As suggested we're making a run-up to 39.5k region, I'll look for closes on longs or re-shorts there.As per yesterday's poll i'll try to do 1 quick update per day. At least giving my inter-range for trading. However, if you're taking such trades I would think that the hit rate would be much lower. I think that so far I have been pretty spot on but like I said, with greater frequency, you would have to take lower probability trade setups more on the intra day. Still juggling my school & work commitments cause I don't intend to full-time trade for the basis of mental sanity and also in pursuit of diversifying my income/cash flow further.As such i'll probably structure and label it into 2 setups.(1) Weekly High Probability Set-ups:This is what I personally trade due to my time schedule but i'll give you guys (2) as an add-on but i'll put a disclaimer and say that (2) is not what i'm personally trading. I only trade (1).(2) Daily Inter-range Key Support and Resistance Levels for Crypto, Stocks & Eventually ForexThis will probably include some news as well daily, whatever interesting I'm reading I guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç Will optimise the postings out more in due course! Ending my school term in a few weeks.</content>

      <content>21st February UpdateBTC & Crypto(1) Larger Time Frame Swings- Still on a Downtrend, we could see relief to 39-40k but even then this will be short-lived. On a low leverage these prices shouldn‚Äôt bother you. Alternatively would be of course OTM put options which I personally employ but nothing too fancy. By laddering exits on shorts as suggest from 38.6 - 37.8k, I think you should have perfectly captured the bottom at 37.9 yesterday. I'm only beginning to ladder re-shorts now.(2) Short-Term Trade Range:-$BTCfaces strong resistance at 39.6-39.8k. Laddering in shorts with an invalidation at 40.3k or tighter is a possible play. Trend still down till we sweep the lows properly, consolidate and hold. Then we‚Äôll have to watch if the floor holds.US Stocks(1) Long Term Holds- Stuff I think that will still retain value in for a long-term hold. Covered Calls on$Tstill work. AT&T is still a necessity and is still profitable as both a business and for doing a CC strategy. If you don‚Äôt have enough capital to do CCs. Consider doing PMCCs.(2) Inter-Day Trading Range-$TSLAputs till under 800 still logical to me.$FSLY$SHOP&$CLOVat reaching very oversold territories at 18.70, 2.11 and 650 respectively at GMT+8 11am now. Might punt a buy soon but none of these are fundamentally sound except$SHOPimo.As always, NFA & DYOR. I personally only do longer term positions.</content>

      <content>(Crypto)For$BTC, we're trading at 37.6k now! As to why I suggested not to take longs and only look for re-shorts! Targeting a sweep of the next lows. Think next support is 35.8 - 36.3k, will possibly look for closes on the shorts there. However, I think this is a weak support. If they give you 33/34k I will definitely put a trailing stop loss/take profits. Still in my put options and fully re-shorted already. Re-shorted the 60% I closed 30% at 38.7k and 30% at 39.5k. This de-risks your previous positions and compounds even more profits!Y'all should be good in profits now ü§ôüèª$TSLAputs still waiting for close!</content>

      <content>22 February 2021:(Crypto)Still downtrending. Any rips should be short-lived, wouldn't consider any longs until 35.8-36.3k which we are fairly close now! Just make sure you ladder your exits well in that region! If you want to run it down you can place a trailing SL/TP when it reaches under 36.3k; what this does is if it continues down you give it the chance to, however if it bounces up this strat immediately TPs. I'll look for re-shorts after closing this bounce from 35.8-36.3k if the bounce is strong.As I mentioned won't be doing alts, unless ETH, BNB, FTT, KCS. No small caps, just coins with high correlation to BTC/Crypto Market Potentially!</content>

      <content>What I mean by the last part was that we choose high correlation alt coins to short in confluence with a downtrending$BTC. This will make you more profits with less leverage as alts tend to fall harder than BTC. This takes a bit of tweaking cause I correlate this data with BTC dominance and do a simple correlation graph to see what works the best for this strategy. Those I listed are what I personally do.This strategy lets you take the same position with less leverage to make the same gains.</content>

      <content>22nd February Update(Crypto)Trailing SL triggered at 36.5k for$BTCso took off 30% some profits there. Still in about 60-70% shorts entered at my 2nd reshort of 39.5k. Whenever we reach an area of support I tend to employ a trailing TP then just walk away. If we continue down, we let it run.Knowing when to put a trailing SL especially placed at a support region can be crucial.Anyway, not too concerned, just a squeeze for late shorters - maybe a quick tap up to 38.4-38.6k for liquidity but I believe trend is still down! If we get another retest down to 36.3k region (+- 0.3k) I would put another trailing SL! Hope this makes sense.(US Stocks)Same old. Puts in$TSLAstill not closed, have time cause it's a 6 months options contract. Not suffering too heavily in Theta Decay. Possibly laddering buys for$SHOP$CLOVvery soon.Overall a pretty decent month so far!</content>

      <content>I think this can be a saviour at times! Better off than trying to pick a perfect bottom to close, when we reach nearing a support region just put a trailing SL for 50% of suggested close and 50% at targeted close for the amount you want to close. So if it bounces you'll be guaranteed to take profits. Like I said, no one ever died taking profits.Sorry if I am a lil spammy lately, trying to do as suggested and update more often!</content>

      <content>Not my cleanest cut, should have held it a little longer, closed some at 38.4-38.6 cause I was a lil panicky. Should trust the gut more in the future. Taking 1-2 days off unless Crypto unless it reaches where I want to long or short. Not trading this inter-range as it consolidates. I don't like trading Wave CDE on the ABCDE Elliot wave on principle. (Refer to Image)Closed 90% of my short futures but still have put options fro 44k so not re-shorting at the moment. Won't be too bummed even if we do go down; still as I said, trendline still bearish.</content>

      <content>Didn't get here unfortunately. I'll honestly not try to time it so much when. Made a mistake by cutting some at 38.4, when my leverage and size were actually good enough to hold the short down forever. I think that's the "problem" with trying to be more active. The more I stare at it, the more itchy fingers I get. I believe a lower leveraged/sized larger swing outweighs touching a position everyday even!Gonna optimise again. However puts on stocks still made me a decent chunk and I do still have crypto put options so it's okay! Still up a bunch for this month üëåüèº Hope you guys are too!</content>

      <content>41.7 - 42.5k is a strong area of resistance for BTC. I'll probably opt to trailing stop loss if we break 40k and take a full profit at the suggested resistance, perhaps even flip short at 41.7-42.5k at the higher end of that resistance.

      <content>Still holding most positions till minimally next week to reassess, will employ trailing stop losses or a stop loss in entry still, don't think we crash twice so fast without squeezing late shorts, so doubt we retrace back to entries. (UNLESS WW3 happens which then it's entirely out of my control).Off the bat, resistance areas would be:835-840$TSLA(already 820 on pre-market)163-165$ABNB745$SHOPpotentially the only one I might take profits here, -$CLOV(we had a crazy run on this 20-30% last day)All of these should be in decent 10-20% profits without any leverage/margin already. I am not buying to hold at these prices, think Macro and economic climate still too bearish. So gonna opt to take profits faster.</content>

      <content>Been viewing$SHOP$CLOVmore often than other the previous few days, cause I mentioned specifically these 2 were heavily oversold. I think$CLOValready did a fair enough bounce, waiting on$SHOPto go a bit higher!Unfortunately if you weren't awake at 3am last night it would have been difficult to catch good entries but I still think we have legs on$SHOP,$TSLAfor a little bit.$CLOV,$ABNBand$BTCwould not be a strong buy for me here.1 Key Indicator you can use as a contrarian indicator would be to look at the VIX or VVIX levels; these are inverse ETFs, generally if VIX is above 35 and VVIX is 150 or closing there, we can see it as a sign of possible relief. Many people use VIX to hedge, so if it reaches these levels you can expect the opposite movement on the general markets. As people take profits on inverse ETFs, this can also provide short-term relief indirectly to the underlying ETF. There are a few indicators I personally use: RSI, VPVR, Max Pain Options, VIX/VVIX Levels, your usual MA & Stochastics. Will try teach them slowly here.</content>

      <content>$TSLAat 845 onwards right now as I suggested is a sell for me on a short-term time frame. Been targeting this number in both the groups under 750 I was signalling a buy. Do think we have potential for more upward movements but if you have any leveraged/margin positions I would be at least taking profits. Not opening puts or shorting yet but closing call options.$BTCat resistance for me. As I mentioned earlier 40.5k onwards is not a bad position to attempt short ladders.$CLOVI think will meet short-term resistance at 2.8. Not a buy here nor short. Just areas to continually take profits from our buys a week ago.$SHOPI am still holding. Being patient with this awhile longer, still in profit but not a lot. Initial entry still 650.$ABNBhope you took some profits at the resistance I mentioned a few days prior. I am still holding my spot positions for these. Not too concerned. Think we still have a strong floor at 130-140.</content>

      <content>For$TSLAwe're moving up super quick. Currently the one I am looking at the most. I think i'll just employ a trailing stop loss. Give it the chance to run into 877, but i'll take profits continuously otw up there and if we do break 845 again downwards and holds there, I'll cut all.</content>

      <content>Entire chunk here to me looks like a take profit for my$TSLApositions. Put a stop loss at 845 and let it run into 859-882. Scale in exits at that region. Bear in mind, if you're just buying and holding you may too. This is NFA. I am expecting it to retrace later DYOR.Prospectively:859-861 35% Close868-872 35% Close877-882 30% Close</content>

      <content>Same plan on$BTCas a week ago. Tiny short ladders or take profits at our current resistance. However, given the nature of this latest$BTCmovement. I am more inclined we do a liquidation cascade on shorts to tap into the 41.4-42.5k region.If I were to short and prospectively aim for a perfect entry i'll try 42.5-42.9k. There's strong liquidity to tap there. Anything before that on a down-bias should just be tiny shorts or take profits on longs. General bias and trend is still down for me. I do not believe we are in a bull-run period! Put Options may not be entirely bad if you got 3 months out.</content>

      <content>$CLOValso at 2.8 now, not sure how many of you guys are in this but I am laddering out anything above 2.8 and putting a trailing stop loss just under this region as well at 2.75 or something. I generally believe in this saying; let your winners run, and cut your losers fast. So if we're running i'll let it run. However, if we do reach my full TP region like for$TSLAat 877-880 and$CLOVat around this region. I am taking them quick.</content>

      <content>Honestly if you're lazy or your size/leverage or options are far out enough; here isn't bad to take profits across the board either!I am just giving guidelines to ladder if you do enjoy swing trading monthlies. I think this relief will be short-lived. I expect us to go back down heavily closing in to the FOMC hearing on March 16th again out of fear & uncertainty perhaps.</content>

      <content>28th February UpdateIn summary:$TSLAladdered sells all the way up to 880, heavy resistance there.$CLOVanything above 2.8 is good for closes on call options. Spot I think still can hold$BTCcurrently in a close region for any longs. Shorts I will only consider 41.4-42.5k and with a positive kurtosis and right skewed with more positions at the higher end.The rest not moving much, refer to previous updates!</content>

      <content>1st March Update:Both$TSLA$CLOVstill playing out as expected, at $871 & $2.80 respectively. I am closing for these slowly.$BTCcurrently at 43.5k; if in a short I think we will retrace later. If you're not too levered I think I will wait it out.

      <content>3 March Update:42.6-42.9k is another crucial level for$BTCto hold. Still think the trend is down but if you ever want to de-risk or lower your margin/leverage of your shorts, you can close some positions there. I find it easier to hold positions when they're smaller. Less stressful as well! Looking more into stocks at the moment cause the FOMC hearing & Global Tensions make it that there is quite a lot of liquidity and risk on movements to take.Potentially looking at puts for$TSLAsoon now, considering we're double testing out 879-882 region. Starting to ladder in small puts. Think this goes to 920 at max on the short time-frame, so I'll ladder in with knowledge of that.$CLOV$ABNBnot trading at the moment, fully out of calls still.$SHOPstill holding awhile more as I mentioned!</content>

      <content>$CLOVif you are still holding buys I suggest to cut. I was just buying for the short squeeze potential at $2 to $2.80. Already a 40% gain.$TSLAattempting puts to ladder at 895-910. I think if you spread out your shorts/puts/takeprofits on this region; we will retrace after.Ruble has been crashing hard, been just researching into Russian Banks & Defence Stocks lately. Still holding my$LMT!For$BTCif I am still on my shorts I will probably deleverage some then attempt to short higher. However, I still believe we see lower in the coming months. I think it's foolhardy to think we don't touch 30ks again. Still holding my put options from 44k.Working on some comprehensive PDF trading guides; will send here next week!</content>

      <content>For$BTC42.6k did not hold. If you are in shorts I think finally at long last you can put a stop loss in take profit. Just hold out a little longer.

      <content>4th March:For BTC shorts from 42.9k-44k. Think we break under 40k for one more sweep. If we're in a consolidation wedge which is what I am thinking. Safe TP around 38.8k mark. I think if we get a move it should be now. So I am finally putting stops but I'll try to let this run to TP. Hard to explain my ideas through text but general idea is in the charts.</content>

      <content>4th March 2022:For$BTCyou can be patient. Think the longs are already trapped; Looking at 38.8k prospectively, i'll reassess later how and where to ladder out shorts to take profits or roll longer. There are 2 waves I drew: one is a elliot extension wave, one is a consolidation wave to form a triangle wedge. Not sure which one forms yet. Leaning on triangle wedge since we're still far out from any news like the FOMC hearing or crucial CME expiration dates. As I mentioned above, I didn't get a perfect entry either... mostly started laddering shorts at 42.9-44k. I mentioned I would cut if we did get 46/47k. It's okay to not be perfect all the time, just understand the general trend and slowly ladder!$TSLAso far has been playing out very perfectly. Took profits from $730 at $870-882 and flipped to puts from 878-882. Holding these and not adding. I principally don't add on my size even if they're small. I am okay with smaller profits as long as they're consistent!Will chart this out by next week. So far still a decent week!</content>

      <content>38.8k should be a safe TP. Think we break under 40k and potentially consolidate in this region awhile longer till the FOMC hearing... I would probably close and opt to re-short closer to hearing date.As I mentioned, longs are trapped already. I have been short-biased the entire month if you can't tell... Don't think we break to 46/47k anytime soon actually.Watching$ABNB$TSLAfor calls in the next few weeks. I do enjoy buying the dip on these...

      <content>For$BTCI think the lowest we can go to me is 36.5-36.8 in the short time frame. Don't think we go down too deep just yet. But even then I think we do a final wick back up above 40k to aim for D before going down. D would be around 41.2-41.8 imo. You can take some profits and then reshort or just hold the short down. I think either way, i'll still be holding some shorts down as I expect lower for$BTCeventually! As long as you get paid in funding, nothing to worry about for holding shorts.</content>

      <content>$ROKUis worth less today than it was worth before the pandemic. Yet, relative to its pre-pandemic levels, Roku has 60% more users, 145% more revenues and 13X the EBITDA.It indeed looks like we're free falling but on a technical standpoint we're at long-standing support. Above this, yes, revenue misses due to supply chain issues from the pandemic in the q4 earnings are a point of concern. However, this can be relatively easily fixed over time as governments start learning to live with COVID. This just depends on the industry."Based on the likelihood that a meaningful portion of the $60bn-$70bn of traditional TV advertising market will migrate to connected TV platforms in the coming years, we have maintained our modest sized position during this period of tempered viewership growth."Long-term still think it has potential. Very high on my radar. Actually punting a few calls soon. Since we're also on a Technical Support at 100-110</content>

      <content>TLDR;I am bullish on US stocks but only at certain regions and opting to take profits fast. Buyer for$ABNB$TSLA$CLOV$MLCO. Same few. Using monthly options for this.Bearish on Crypto on a weekly time frame still. Not trading too heavily on crypto at the end of this wedge. Using perpetual futures for this.Bullish on Commodities (Personally haven't bought much) Still expanding into this asset class on my personal portfolio diversification.

      <content>19th March Update:Most stocks on a major run-up today specifically$SHOP,$CLOV,$ABNB,$TSLAall still doing well.  I am just taking profits for$TSLAand$ABNB. Did not take any positions for the others. Still think there is a bit more upside for most counters. But I won't be a buyer for those that already did 20-30% in the last couple of days. Feds did a very low interest rate hike and Powell basically suggested that the Economy is still strong. I don't believe we reach ATH this year still.If you want a decent R:R play that hasn't flew yet, I might look at$ROKUon Monday, currently at 124. Will look for puts starting end of next week I think!</content>

      <content>$BTCstill in this wedge, not too convinced we get out of this downtrend pattern. I think here is okay for a low-leverage short. Current Price (41.8k) Just ladder in. Even the most we can see is 43.8k I presume. Think we still see 30k again. Still missing the D and E waves.</content>

      <content>20th March Update:In my first ladder amount of shorts for$BTCentered at 42.3k, will hold this down but placing a stop loss soon. Will let this wedge play out if it can... Purple box is quite big so going to leave more ammo to Stop Loss and re-short if need be... Won't rule out it going higher as well. Just relying on this wedge playing out and that we end up in a squeeze.So far my ideas have been largely correct so I'll stick with my guts!$TSLA&$ABNBi'll likely start closing some on the calls next week!</content>

      <content>Gonna try to hold till 39.3k there-ish. Will rethink the numbers later. If you want to close earlier 41.3-41.4k also presents plausible support. Inbetween these 2 number is a low volume node, don't expect any support there... Still in the short, shifting SL slowly.</content>

      <content>Not really convinced on this rally, depending on how this daily closes, we could still be in this triangle. Still think long-term trend is down, but preferably if we're taking positions to try to suffer as little pain as possible.Not wrong to take shorts/puts at these prices. I'd opt to ladder in positions super super slowly right now. Already in some shorts.</content>

      <content>Just broke down into 42.3k again... My average sells were about 43.2k. Took only about 400k in Contract Positions but happy with the entry. Generally I don't tend to shorts add along the way down, I add shorts only on the way up.Always remember, buy on dumps, sell on pumps. Simple logic!Will place a tight stop loss on the short here at 42.6k, which I expect will trigger but I am okay with taking profits at this support even though I still possibly expect 38.6-39.3k. It's just risk-management.</content>

      <content>$TSLAis flying. Ladder in slowly if you are going puts. We did retrace to 970 on market open. Not intending to fade this market open. Luckily I have some$ROKUand$FSLYand$CLOV.$CLOVmade one of the biggest moves, almost a 2x already from last week.I would expect$BTCto run alongside stocks given the market conditions so I am just going to trade within the numbers I gave yesterday, but tighter as the wedge consolidations.</content>

      <content>Crypto, particularly$BTCis quite slow right now... Might have to look into some alts.So for instance, if we are trading on support at 42.3-42.5k, and resistance at 42.7-43.1k, the next time it bounces off there we shift both support and resistance tighter by a margin of 0.786 based on fibo. But bear in mind this is a smaller triangle within the larger wedge. I'd just take these trades if I were day trading. Still in my 43.2k shorts but closing some more to de-risk. Will re-short higher, possibly at 42.8-42.9k.</content>

Already closed most of my shorts yesterday in small profits as I mentioned to aim to re-short higher. Starting to ladder in shorts here now with a tight SL at 43.9-44.1k. Just playing the triangles. Don't think we break out yet. Still going to be ranging, so going to play the triangle for 1-2 more waves.</content>

      <content>issue with taking a bias is that of course you can't be 100% correct all the time; was underwater (at a loss) on most of my shorts/puts but I did some active management for both of them.$BTCshort already in profit but$TSLAstill not there yet.

      <content>27th March Update:Waiting for the Market Open still on the TSLA put options. Think this is still in an area of resistance. Managed to average out my previous shorts and deleverage. Still holding some shorts but I am still averaging in slowly. I still am on the belief we are not recovering into a full-blown bull market. I think the macro conditions have improved with the low interest rate hikes but given the upcoming FOMC hearings and hikes. Don‚Äôt think we get ATH for$BTCor$TSLAlike some are suggesting. In this scenario, I would just be going low leverage/margin for shorts and puts and waiting for it to truly bottom before buying heavily. It‚Äôs hard to time the top but I don‚Äôt believe we have bottomed so still biased down.Tomorrow onwards also going to be providing some analysis on FX markets, will share more details on this later but largely the NY times. Been backtesting for awhile and trading on a smaller size but the trading style will be daily and different from the Crypto/Stocks one. You can follow along with this log for this as well if you are interested in FX. If you're new to FX markets, have a guide coming soon too so don't worry!</content>

      <content>[Forex analysis] EUR/USD 4HAs we start the week, price is currently range bound between 1.0900 and 1.1137. we can expect to open potential long positions soon and ride it all the way up and out of the range as price comes down to visit our Demand zones marked out on the 15M and 1H.Still, until I receive confirmation that price wants to go up from my demand zones marked out in the form of (1) a change of character (CHoCH) or (2) 2 Higher Highs formed, I will still be entertaining quick shorts from my 1H supply area as Price is still bearish in 4H substructure.</content>

      <content>29th March Forex updateEUR/USD M15Closed out my entire long position from last night as stated when price reached the 1H Supply zone. (Overall +11.7%)After putting in a series of Higher highs today, the price narrative is now confirmed bullish so as of now we can look to long the market again from the new M15 Demand zone. The potential take profit areas will be the new M15 Supply zone above (conservative) & the current 4H high at 1.1370 (aggressive).Still, I will be wary of a reversal to the downside as price had created a trendline of liquidity (aka stop loss orders waiting to be taken out) on its way up.</content>

      <content>29th March FX Update:Price seems to be rejecting off from 4H structural highs here after price changes character (CHoCH) to temporary bearish state.Thus, Sells are now valid from both M15 Supply zones (with lower time frames confirmation) and can look to target 1st take profit level 1 and leave some runners until M15 Demand Zone at the bottom.</content>

      <content>Look for the second TP right now at 47185-47255 as I mentioned, market extremely volatile today. You can also flip a long here at D with the SL mentioned around 46.8. Roughly we are going to be playing this range, since we got a big move yesterday.</content>

      <content>Close TP is around 47185, flip long is about 47125-47165 I think. Put an SL below and play the range. My stance is to play the range from A, B, C, D, E waves but be quicker to cut longs with an SL and be more willing to hold shorts with a more flexible buffer at this region. I think after the consolidation wedge forms we will break down back under 46/47k in the long-term view.</content>

      <content>For$BTCWe're at flip long region now, SL should be somewhere below the blue line. Ladder slowly as usual; I don't tend to trade so actively but after a big move like yesterday, volatility makes this quite profitable to earn.</content>

      <content>EUR/USD FX update:Would have gotten stopped out by 2 pips if entered a short at the first supply zone. I personally did not enter the trade as price action on the lower time frames (1minute) was not very clean. To me, the Supply zone at the top is still valid to trade from as there is a build up of liquidity just right below it.Not much opportunities today as price looks like it is currently in an indecision phase for tonight's NY session so we stay cash. Still up over 10RR on the week, going to stay patient.As for concerns on how to go about trading this strategy effectively for FX and others too, a new guide will be coming out soon so not to worry!</content>

      <content>Get ready for exits. We got a perfect long entry at 47125-47165. This exit make sure to stagger them out 47569-47737. Potentially can flip a short but place a further out SL for this next short. Maybe 48.2k even. Use the profits as buffer and of course, stick to your same size.</content>

      <content>Did get some exits this time round. Just exiting longs at the moment, not entering shorts yet. In that whole range I gave previously, use your longs to ladder out into flips short much deeper in. Just exit and take profits first.Might do a guide on how to ladder & utilise stops cause I feel sometimes that's arguably more important than technicals.</content>

      <content>Very prospective analysis I did on March 28th, it's not going to freefall so don't trade this too crazily, just some support regions I wrote... take it with a pinch of salt. I expect a short to 46.3k and possibly 45k region. This is for the longer term swing setups and also regions I am looking for swing longs. Also please respect stop losses for each.</content>

      <content>30th March Forex update:EUR/USD 4HPrice has finally made new 4H structural highs. We can look to scalp some quick longs from the 2 valid demand zones if price comes into it and changes character to bullish in the zone on the M15. Will provide an update if that happens, then we can start opening longs from valid demand zones.But looking at the big picture for EUR/USD, we want to see if price can come into our 4H supply zone soon & reject from there to continue EUR/USD's bearish run on the Higher time frame narrative.</content>

      <content>Just my 2 cents, you can also opt to put a trailing SL under 45.7k in a bit like I mentioned... so basically we let it run down and give it the chance to, but be ready to take profits since we close to my support regions already. I expect there to be some relief soon. I'll at least close majority when we get into 45315-45511 and flip a small long with a tight SL.If all these methodologies seem confusing for you. Not to worry... Going to release a series of videos on a new website on how to specifically ladder & place SLs soon. Existing users in this chat will get it free. Will charge new users, perks for joining early ‚úåÔ∏è</content>

      <content>Ah stops triggered! Luckily I did put a SL in TP at 46.6k. Still a decent day yesterday, Ideally I just TP at different ranges as opposed to taking so many trades. I think part of the problem of doing these short-term trades is that I lose sight of the bigger picture. Was attempting to re-short but didn't fill cause I fell asleep. Problem is also these odd hours I sometimes just am too tired. Might go back to slightly longer time frame plays.</content>

      <content>In all honesty, even though I didn't close at the exact bottom at 44.2k, taking the short from 47.7k to 45.5k is good enough. After trading for awhile, I know better than to hold a position too long or adjust my profit regions too much. It's a good thing we took the day break as it flew back to 47k earlier today as well. Just got back into my short here. Will start monday off with a stocks update!</content>

      <content>3 April Crypto Update:Off the bat, i'm looking at 45255-45415 as a decent area of support. Long Run we should probably test 43 lows still, hypothetically 43.2-43.4k, but i'll put a trailing SL rather than take profits sometimes as I believe the overarching trend (like big big trend) is still down for the time being. Going to be MIA tomorrow to work on some new material, Full updates on Stocks, Forex & Crypto on Monday.</content>

      <content>4th April Crypto & Stocks Update:I am still holding on to my shorts. Not really concerned with this movement. Think we‚Äôre going to be ranging here once again for a couple days. I‚Äôll be taking shorts at resistance but no longs on supports. Think the trend is down on a mid-term time frame. I‚Äôm still in my short so not re-shorting‚Ä¶Both 46355 and 46785-46855 are the resistances for this range. I‚Äôll probably opt to close some at 45030-45155. But I‚Äôll hold some for even lower. Looking at macro conditions with Interest Rate Hikes next month looming. Potentially we could revisit 41.3-41.7k again.$TSLAas I mentioned in the other group we should see some re-tracement down to 1030 but I don‚Äôt see any cause of concern in the next few weeks for any lower than that. I am just not buying calls at these prices right now though.</content>

      <content>4th April Commodities & Forex:The global economy is still largely affected by rising inflation rates so its a good time to look at safe haven assets like gold, although gains will be modest. It also  just bounced right off a strong fibonacci level at 1890 last week. I will be bullish if it can continue to go up, preferbly past the 1965 levels.For this week's outlook on EUR/USD, all I am interested in now is for price to break out of the range it is in before establishing a directional bias. Other than that, a crucial price level to look at for price to make a huge reversal up to new structural highs will be at 1.10050 to 1.09700. Will be monitoring price action in that zone closely.</content>

      <content>4th April Forex EUR/USD UpdateAs predicted on the weekly outlook earlier today, Price is now approaching an extreme point of interest/Demand Zone. (Meaning the gains could be quite huge depending on how long you want to hold the trade - normally I would take partials to end the night and leave runners for higher take profit levels)So for tonight's session, both zones are valid to take a trade from. But for a higher probability trade, wait for price to perform a Change of Character (CHoCH) on the M5 or M15 time frame</content>

Already closed all my shorts yesterday at 43.8k, now in an extremely small long.We either wait for a retest of lows at C, under 43k, if that holds, we buy. Other option is wait for above 44k to short. In-between I am not trading. Will look at other assets.</content>

      <content>11th April Crypto Update:Current Price 43.1k, where we got stopped out at entry the previous time. I don't mind a re-long attempt here. Reason I chose to just get stopped out and not hold the long is because I don't want the stress of holding an underwater long position throughout the weekend anyway. However, I think this is a second opportunity to catch a move for a squeeze up. I do think we are going to squeeze out some shorts tomorrow. We will have to tap liquidity above 44k at least once before going down.Regions for long close and/or flip short would be 44035-44068 (Likely)I will go for re-shorts at both of these resistance but with a strategy of laddering in both entries and putting a stop loss at entry after each rejection. No matter what I would want to hold a short into the upcoming FOMC hearing I feel.</content>

      <content>11 April Forex EUR/USD update:Price is turning bullish now after reacting off of the last Demand zone and forming 2 consecutive higher highs. As it also left some liquidty on the trendline drawn below to be swept, it looks like an ideal long setup here.We can look for longs from either of the demand zones marked out.</content>

      <content>For Crypto:Current$BTCPrice: 40.2kI honestly think we get a relief move up before a continuation downwards, it's just very dangerous to long here with the global conditions. However, if you want you can punt a small long. I would prefer to wait for 42.8k and above to start laddering in shorts. Otherwise just holding in cash.For Stocks:Most Counters haven't reached a floor yet. Think$TSLAneeds to test the 800s region to get a strong proper bounce. Can hold the $1080 puts further. Generally be buying at least 2-4 months on your expirations if you can afford it. Easier to hold this way!</content>

      <content>Literally started moving in the 5 minutes as I was typing this out üòÖ Think there's more upside for$BTC. Still not a bad position for a small long if you want, significant resistance only above 42.7k. Bear in mind, this is just a relief rally before further downside imo. This means you have to be quick while taking profit if you are in longs. Just my take on it!</content>

      <content>It is a bank holiday so thought I would share some educational content for you guys instead on why I also use the "Smart Money Concept" (SMC) to trade (fx) markets. Take a read toimprove your understanding to why the market moves the way it does!To prevent confusion, the retail trading pattern / support resistance levels DO WORK, but in my experience one has to go a little deeper than just simple support and resistance lines to be able to trade off them effectively & SMC is a great way to help yourself understand why price moves the way it does instead of just thinking we got manipulated when trades don't go our way.If interested, more resources are available on our site for you guys!</content>

      <content>19th April Update:For Crypto;A move to 42.2-42.7k on$BTCwould be healthy. Don't think we get a market crash until the FOMC hearing. I'm still bearish on Crypto Markets but I believe we still a final relief rally... Numbers are the same! Just being patient, the lack of recent movement means not much updates here tbh.For Stocks;$SHOP&$CLOVbeing hammered while$TSLAfinds some relief finally. Not a terrible price now for a$TSLAput at $1004. Don't think this we see 4 digits for that much longer. I do see this falling to 800s once again actually.</content>

      <content>19th April FOREX EUR/USD Update:Quite a few straightforward setups that I can see playing out tonight despite being in range still.As price is still pretty bearish on 4H and M15, would be more interested in the shorts though but a long with extra confirmation (CHoCH) will be fine too.</content>

      <content>But on the higher time frames (4H), if you want to swing trade (typically 1-2 weeks) this pair instead of day trade, I would take a close look at opening shorts in these 2 zones to ride prices down as price will remain overall bearish as long as these 2 zones are not broken.</content>

      <content>Forex Update 25th AprilPrice melted this afternoon during London session timing (2pm-ish) again.. New York sessions at night have been kinda bad the last month or so in terms of number of high probability setups.. But markets do get boring in stretches at times so not to worry, more setups will be coming eventually.But for now, these are the areas we can look to short from to ride the bear trend, unless price turns bullish from the Weekly Demand, then I'll update again on areas to long from.</content>

      <content>C already hit, we are continuing the downtrend... Didn't opt to re-short, just holding the remainder of my shorts down. Think we see low 30s in May before the FOMC hearing. Prospectively i'm looking at 29-31k for$BTCas a support region.</content>

      <content>27th April Forex EUR/USD updateHuge huge selling pressure recently on this pair so will only be entertaining shorts until price shows bullish structure on the 4H.The zones marked out are the ones we can short from. The lowest one is definitely at a higher risk of being ran eventually but still valid with a CHoCH on the LTF.</content>

      <content>Next FOMC hearing is on June 15-16.Till then I think we range for US Stocks & Crypto.. Potential swing longs soon at the low 800s for$TSLA!I am also not in total agreement that I/R hikes can go super high because the US Gov would then not be able to afford the I/R payments on the $30 Trillion National Debt, which is soon to be $100 Trillion.The Feds unfortunately have no choice but to keep I/R management within the 25-50 basis point range and taper it accordingly.Sure, the citizens have to suffer inflation but bringing it down too fast would cause the bankruptcy of the state if they can't pay sovereign debt off.</content>

      <content>For forex, doesn't seem like there's any interesting setups tonight. But a textbook entry happened again this afternoon during London session which presented a 1:17RR trade.Did a case study on it anyways so if you're interested can take a look! The market always repeats itself.  Market structure break, find your areas to trade from on the M1 after a CHoCH, enter trade. Booom üòÆ‚Äçüí®</content>

      <content>29th April Crypto Update:For Crypto, already closed what I wanted to close at this region. Holding the rest down. My style of trading involves a lot of waiting but I do believe it's more profitable in the long-term for me!Did not get C to re-short but still holding 60% in shorts from 42.7k. Not panicking... Nothing unexpected here.</content>

      <content>Feb 29th US Stocks Update:Moving day. Closing$TSLAputs here at 865-870, flipping into calls temporarily - Waiting for a double bottom to form and for one more sweep of the lows to enter into calls 840-865 is a decent region to DCA calls with a flexible SL. Early on our SL has to be more flexible before switching to a trailing SL once we get profits.I think there's still time till the hearing and the interest rates hikes will be tapered slowly. Won't see an immediate market crash.</content>

      <content>Regarding the call options for$TSLAhere. I do believe we see a relief rally into 900s for$TSLAbut my belief is that the extenuating trend is still down. Once we get 900s I will watch very closely for a close. Off the bat, once I am fully in my positions I am going to put TP targets from 988-1028 and a loose trailing SL at 900 and once we get above 950 an extremely tight trailing SL. I am honestly happy with taking profits quickly for calls in a bearish market or recession climate.</content>

      <content>Not sure why I kept posting so many updates about a double bottom sweep for$TSLAand second guessed myself so much. I initially just wanted to enter lumpsum at 865, waiting for another sweep to $840 is just foolhardy and unnecessary. Not much difference when we waited so long for these prices. Now my average is about 870 instead of 865 but whatever... -,-Fully in my buy call postitions already here anyway, holding till $900 at least. Will stop pussyfooting.Plan is as written above...</content>

      <content>We indeed only had 1 proper tap above 42.7k for$BTCüòÖ Still in the short!Reason why I am still in this$BTCshort: I want to protect this short as best I can. Sure, I can attempt to predict a support and re-short higher to increase profits BUT I am hesistant we get a lot of good bounces along the way down since there is no significant support region. Less stressful for me just holding it down and actively taking profits at each support with the percentage of TP depending on the strength of the support.Increased activity may come with increased profits but it also comes with increased stress. Learnt this the hard way in the past when I fat fingered large contracts.I am a day trader on some days depending on the setup but this larger time frame swing trading is a style that works for me.Higher probabilistic wins. Perhaps less profit. but less leverage. less button pushing. less stress.</content>

      <content>Got stopped out of$TSLApositions last  night at $900. Also did say to take some profits at these resistances as well. Still think we're in a down-trend. Unfortunately didn't get in my re-shorts... Same as crypto I would prefer to just hold the position down instead of trying to time and buy. These bounces are to be honest too insignificant.</content>

      <content>FOMC Hearing will be on May 3/4th, expecting a down market for the quarter. Still looking for re-opening of puts for$TSLAas well as holding my BTC short. Not adding to shorts just holding the initial.Closed my $860 call at $900 a couple days back so looking for puts now. If we get to 930-950 for$TSLAi'm actually going to be opening put options.</content>

      <content>Laddering in some small puts here at $905 maybe 20-30% first for$TSLA. I think we're heavily reliant on the hearing news and although the possibility of a 50-75 basis point hike has already largely been priced into the market, I still think Powell might have more instore & choice words for us so expect volatility tomorrow.</content>

      <content>For Forex especially, major pairs have just been consolidating hard the past few days at HTF Point of Interests. This is Financial Institutions just waiting for post-FOMC tonight to bring prices to the levels they are looking at. We may see a bullish reversal here but really we just have wait for them to show their hands and react accordingly (we don't predict). So no fx trades for now!</content>

      <content>For Crypto; Highest we can see is a sweep of 39.5k-39.7k and then I think we go back down. Trend still down. Not adding shorts but if you want at those prices you may... For me, just holding the originial short for$BTC. FOMC Hearing to me doesn't change anything. Macro trend still bearish.</content>

If you entered using the M1 for confirmation, would already be up 10RR  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBut anyways, also want to say if you are in the trade, best to take some partials now or at least set SL at BE.

      <content>Gave my analysis earlier for$TSLAon the Livestream. I think we're gonna open to a very volatile market on Monday. High 700s, Low 800s. Still in puts from 950. Took many good scalps on this counter the last month, check out above as well. I think the video should be up soon - Youtube streams take awhile to process.</content>

      <content>one more break under 34k i'll put a tight trailing SL perhaps to a few hundreds. if we run to my regions i'll punt a close. if we get stopped out, also fine by me. we're getting really close on HTF support regions. patience. gotta close fast for this tp, don't think we get a long sustained drop. quick tap.</content>

      <content>Let me try and explain something here:You got bottom liquidation levels at 32.6k for$BTCand 2404 for$ETHaccording tohyblockcapital.comAfter that the delta is quite red. What does this mean?We're getting quite close to a region of support. From what I understand, it means there's no more money to be made from liquidating sizeable longers after that number - so any further selling after that has to be made from spot selling. The question you have to ask yourself is will price action be dictated by the futures or spot market. Generally, the former has control because futures volume is multitudes bigger than spot. However, if there is a flight to safety and spot just gives up and dumps, then who props up the futures price? This normally is in the prerogative of the exchange to hold prices steady - using something called the Insurance Fund.Anyway, i'll try explain this concept sometime. TLDR; we got no one left to kill below this price point so if we drop it has to be spot dumping, but a very possible relief region coming soon.</content>

      <content>only left my 10% in shorts left, rest are in stables since november last year as you guys know. i think in this market, as long as you are not losing money & you got some ammo to buy the dip later on - you'll be fine. i will deploy the mother load and start scaling in my dry powder in Q3 i presume.for now, i believe for$BTCwe are going to break down below 30k and look towards 28k for a close on the final shorts and small flip longs.exact numbers later!very heavy market these few days... i'm not going to be a fudder, but macro conditions are really bad, there will be some crypto alts that will go close to zero. I still believe in stocks - things like$TSLA$AAPLare still good long term investments.</content>

      <content>when i say crypto alts that will go close to zero - i think things that did a massive run-up last year like ($LUNA,$SOL) with eroding utility or a poor protocol construct are at wayyy biggest risk than things like an large exchange token ($BNB,$FTT).just fyi, i'm still in my tiny bit of shorts. i changed my stance and will not be entering into longs here at 28k. this is not a market i want to be longing or buying yet.i do believe we see lower in Q3 - if we get a full-blown recession - my exact figures are much deeper - always have been. hope everyone is safe!</content>

      <content>Not too much has changed for the crypto market since my last update.But on the side of forex markets,  the EUR/USD pair is looking bearish again after a strong & complex pullback the last couple of weeks & now there's relatively clean areas of interests for shorts. [technical analysis]We can thus expect price to potentially react in the areas marked and if it does, shorts will be in play.</content>

      <content>Over on the forex markets, going into July, the EUR/USD pair seems to be showing signs of reversal to the upside now, after my call for shorts from 1.077 levels earlier this month which played out well.The bias now will be for one final move down before price potentially reverses. So will look for price to give us some tells & areas to long after the major news play out at the start of July.But if price does not bounce out of key support levels well, look for the pair to continue its HTF narrative down.</content>

      <content>Forex update - EUR/USD PairPrice didn't show any strong confirmation at all to continue its bearish move down from key areas yesterday. Thus no trades were taken.After last night's move up, structure on the bigger picture is unconfirmed bullish. Will wait for a few days to let price play itself out for a clearer picture of the direction it wants to go.In the meantime, the only scalp setup I'm interested in tonight would be something like this.</content>

      <content>Forex update 26/7: EUR/USDAn update on the overall movement EUR/USD. Since last week's call for price to drop down to 1.011 levels (Marked in blue arrow), price has consolidated for awhile before finally approaching the targeted levels.Did catch a 14RR short following the trend last week but other than that & a short today during London's session (didn't take), there weren't any high probability setups for me to share during the consolidation..My views on this pair for the next few days are again marked in blue on the right of the chart. Overall bias is still bearish for now.</content>

      <content>28th July FOMC Update:So we just got our 75 basis points hike in the FOMC Hearing a couple minutes ago. Powell has pivoted to a more dovish stance, hinting to taper back hikes on a meeting by meeting basis in the case if CPI & PCE remain softer in the next few months - which is why we see this push up across the board.My opinion still remains that CPI & PCE won't be controlled with such a "soft" hike and Powell will still have to continue cooling off the market; tldr: bear trend continues till inflation is properly controlled. Not really looking at new entries for puts and re-shorts, still holding my original ones.In other news,$METAjust missed earnings in this latest tech earnings; this might be one to look out for that I believe still has deeper to go if they keep self-sabotaging the platform with their poor acquisitions and restructuring.</content>

      <content>Forex Update 28/7 EUR/USDMarkup for tonight's session and as pointed out on Tues, we were looking for a temporary pull back up to 1.022 levels (the zone above) & it played out nicely this afternoon. However, I only trade New York sessions at night so I missed it.Still, will be looking for price to break the highs now with or without a temporary pullback to 1.012 area.Price action is looking cleaner recently thus I see more high probability trades coming back again!

      <content>Crypto Update August 2022:$BTCprice right now is ranging between 23-24k, I am still in the belief that the recession isn‚Äôt over and we have yet to establish strong enough lows for a reversal.That being said, I think there is some upside here to tap liquidity. Considering we have until September 20-21 to the next hearing, barring that there is not extenuating bad news or war crisis the next few months, we can hope to tap 29.5-31.1k as a proper resistance before continuation of the downtrend on Crypto. As of now, if I had longs, I would consider closing at 24.9-25.1k or place a tight stop there and let it run up to that bigger resistance region. Above that point, if you want to take a safer R:R longer-term play, ladder in shorts slowly up to 29.5-31.1k.The reason I am only analysing$BTCis because I think it is still the market leaders and alts will still correspond to$BTCprice movement. Will only touch alts at a larger area of interest, not in a low volume area. These are of course larger swing move plays and not meant for a day-trading style.Trade Crypto and FX with me here:https://www.xm.com/gw.php?gid=192102</content>

      <content>Crypto Update August 2022 (Part 2)Getting to my first region of 24.9k-25.1k, on longs right now you can consider running a tight stop loss after tomorrow to see if this region holds. I'd wait for tomorrow's reaction and the global markets to open. If we successfully break this region, I am of course looking at my next PoC at 29.5-31.1k where I will be flipping into shorts once again with some size. A lot of this move is fuelled by the lower than expected inflationary pressures that the Feds have "successfully" managed to curtail & contain. Wrote about this in the newsletter in the main channel!

      <content>For forex pair EUR/USD, price looks like it is finally coming back down into favourable demand zones after a huge spike up due to news in the US CPI.Thus, as the internal structure is still bullish, for now I would look to get in some quick buys from the areas marked out in tonight's chart markup.</content>

      <content>Update on EUR/USD, continued from yesterday's trade plan.Price did react well from my demand zone but until I see the target high gets broken, the trend is still only unconfirmed bullish atm.Still, buys with LTF entry confirmation are valid on the two new zones marked out.</content>

      <content>Been a boring past 2 days on EUR/USD where price is just trading sideways.But these are the points of interest i'll be looking for a good reaction off of & then scale in some trades from there.Point to note though, no matter what kind of market you trade in, its best to wait for a breakout on either side before you get in. Always wait for the big banks to show their hands first.</content>

      <content>22 August Crypto Update:Took some shorts at my first resistance at 24.9-25.1k for$BTCwhich was exactly how I called it if you look at the time stamp. Not fully loaded in as I was entertaining the smaller possibility of a move to 29.5k. But still in a good position here, just waiting it out.On the chart our ascending wedge just broke down. However, with no fuel to further push it down. I think we slow down here for awhile unless we get more FUD.</content>

      <content>29th August Crypto Update:Nothing much to update. i‚Äôm still in these shorts. As I said earlier on twitter, contingent on the inflation data and subsequent interest rate hike, I think we find a bottom in Crypto in the next year. I‚Äôll be short-biased till then. Looking at one last big drop till I look for longs again.I'm still scalping a small account but my larger portfolio is hedged in USD as well as put options. Another thing that i'll be looking into soon is gold. Like it or not, in a recessionary climate and with the US Public Debt, i'll still allocate some portion of my portfolio into Gold. Will do a video breaking down my portfolio arrangement soon.</content>

      <content>Forex EUR/USD updateSo an update, yesterday's trade was fully closed out at a total of +8.6% (20% runner closed out at 23RR).For now, the main target is still to break the low of 0.99 but the internal structure is kind of just trading sideways if we zoom out to see thus there isn't really any strong directional bias at the moment. So for today, would only entertain a quick short if my pattern drawn out, plays out.Trade Forex at XM with $50 bonus credit</content>

      <content>7 September Crypto UpdateI'm still on these 24.2k$BTCshorts! I'm trying to put out more opinions for alt coins and other stock counters out there but still quite limited with my time. I've always been saying i'll reassess in Q3 2022. Still looking at one more set of fresh lows before I think we potentially get a proper reversal to open up 2023.Sorry if this new trading style is a little slow, but we still have a 100% win rate on Crypto the last year with this method! Always remember that slow compounding is far superior and mentally sustainable as opposed to fast wins in the long run!</content>

      <content>Gold (XUA/USD) just broke the historical support level of 1680 late last week as predicted two weeks back.Will be interesting to see how things unfold on the chart after the news release on Fed's September interest rate hikes on Sep 21.The way the charts are lining up , I am inclined to think that Fed's may soon opt for 1/2 100 bps rate hike to tackle inflation more aggressively, and then we should see safe-haven assets like Gold start to climb back up after huge dumps during the rate hikes.Trade Gold CFDs</content>

      <content>Alot of huge news happening today & tomorrow so those that are trading do be cautious! (Always use a stop loss)But for EUR/USD which has been ranging last few days, it really seems like EUR just doesn‚Äôt have any strength to push higher at the moment (in both fundamental & technical analysis).So I‚Äôll be looking to get in shorts if i do get confirmation when price enters my zone around 1.003 ( Or price could just melt from here ü§∑)Trade EUR/USD here</content>

      <content>Forex EUR/USD update:This afternoon, price broke the target low with a strong impulsive move to the downside, just like how we mapped it out yesterday night!Price is hovering around a critical support area now so won't be trading until we get a strong move away from here, especially with FOMC reports coming in at 2am tonight. My guess is that we'll turn bullish from here on for awhile though but its ok I'll just wait for more confirmation on where price wants to go before taking any new trades.</content>

      <content>For EUR/USD, the obvious trend is down now after last week‚Äôs FOMC but what we can look for right now is a complex pullback up into the 1.00 parity level (Also a nice confluence is the 62/70 fibs level at 1.00).From there, we‚Äôll see if price gives us a favourable reaction to continue our shorts.Trade EUR/USD here</content>

      <content>Updated outlook on EUR/USD.Price wasn't able to get a strong enough reaction yesterday to continue down from my zones..but its ok we adjust and move on.Still, there were 2 valid quick scalps to get into from my zones if we traded this afternoon.. but the lesson/point that I want to share here is thatwe do not have to catch the full 100RR moves that we so often see on social media to be profitablein trading (especially day trading). In fact, a lot of profitable traders out there only try to catch a 1 to 5 RR trades & close their positions no matter how much further the trade could go in their favour.Find a consistent strategy that works for you, is profitable in the long run & stick to it!

      <content>EUR/USD was finally able to show some signs of strength & close above parity level of 1.00.Still, it will need to close above 1.02 to really turn to bullish sentiments.

      <content>EUR/USDThe long setup wasn't there for us last week as it indeed rejected heavily from 0.995 area & now that there's a buildup of liquidity below, it seems that price is just waiting to dump heavily in the grand scheme of things. (Unless we close above 1.02)Still, Price is seeing bullish order flow again so I'll be looking to get into quick longs to 1.01 level for now.</content>

      <content>2 completely degenerate charts you can day trade if you want to make a quick buck.FTT & USDT/USD stablecoin pairings.What you would need for this. At this point, no TA needed. no FA needed. Just wait for the significant parties to tweet, or write a script if you have to, and trade based of that. Highly liquid, highly volatile, highly profitable, and also highly risky. One of the largest moves i've seen on a intrahour trade.</content>

      <content>9th November Crypto/Stocks Update:This is more of a post-mortem update. I am sure some of you guys might be affected by the markets and know someone who got hit as well. I have taken a small loss, albeit still sizeable as well. We move on.I do think there is still downside to this market on both stocks and crypto. Notable counters would be looking at the support at $130-150 for$TSLA, a quick wick under $10,000 for$BTCand under $800 for$ETHhave all been in consideration for me. I posted these thoughts on Twitter months ago if you want to go take a look. Best to be careful with your funds on CEXs for now, as the contagion and repercussions of the recent events unfold. A lot of this has to do with the 3AC implosion, causing Alameda, Genesis, Jump all to face insolvency and requiring bailouts causing the liquidity crisis in Crypto. For stocks, most earnings are dismal, we did see a run-up as expected into midterms. We only have a plausible Santa Claus rally coming but be cautious training into such headwinds. More details in my next video!</content>

      <content>A perfect long setup from our zone here in EUR/USD during the CPI release but trade wasn't taken as I typically avoid trading minutes before/after major news...Heading into Nov & Dec, Trading volumes/Price Action will typically be quite bad so high probability setups will be hard to come by but oh wells the goal is just not to give back all the pips we gained earlier in the year!Will post a simple breakdown in a bit of the setup tonight on the M1, using the CHoCH pattern.</content>

      <content>EUR/USD outlook for the week/in the medium term.With expectations that inflation has peaked, the Euro was able to finally break its previous macro high (& critical parity level) against the USD.Still, loads of liquidity lies below 1.00 & I wouldn't be surprised if price does a final trace back all the way down to 1.00 or 0.96 level again before continuing its supposed bull trend.Any buys right now would have to still involve conservative take profit levels.</content>

      <content>18th November Market Update:Some key price supports I am looking at; At the moment, we should expect a Santa Claus Rally or some stability in the markets this next month; I still think we resume the bearish downtrend in Q1 2023, I will ladder in long-term DTE bearish options strategy on$SPY, we're right at the resistance right now 4100 to 4200 is key (Video coming soon on this I promise). If you want to take a ride up, this santa claus rally,$ABNBis a possible opportunity right now at under $100. I see travel resuming, the property market cooling and the rental market to still be fluid and liquid. In terms of cashflow, I think they will still be a good investment as we make our way in 2023. Even if the general market goes up, I think$TSLAmight still go down in the short-term considering the shaky news there, along with a weakening TA indicators, either case, I think 115-145 presents a very good buying opportunity there if we get there. I'll ladder in on the day and update.For Crypto, I am still expecting a 8-10k$BTCtarget eventually but completely removing my exposure on  CEXs for the time being. I am shorting on XM (Link in Pinned Message) but a small amount only. My rationale is that opening derivatives on a non-crypto based company removes the risk of a bankrun or an exchange not honouring if Crypto does face insolvency or a liquidity crunch.This is my current take but it will evolve as we get to our next FOMC Hearing!</content>

      <content>20th November Market Update:So PPI data has just been released November 16, indicating a slower than expected producer price increase. We are starting to see inflation being controlled and rate hikes slowing down. All this in a positive earnings environment.We have also just seen a run-up to 4000+ on the SPY. Do we still have leg-room for more?I think yes. We remain in a relatively stable period this Q4 as we approach a prospective Santa Claus Rally.Are we still in a recessionary environment?Also yes, but it's largely been priced in and I think this next year is for buying. Perhaps not the S&P directly as we might revisit lows but I don't believe we go much deeper (At most 3300 range). Even them, there are several distressed assets already at multi technical lows worth considering soon;$TSLA$BTC$ABNB$GOOGL, yes even$META. There's not much more lower these can go and I think Q1 2023 is time to start laddering in. In the meantime, I will still taking shorter term trades.Sharing more on this here(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoohBPM4TM8&t)</content>

      <content>8th December 2022Current markets are indeed boring I must admit, but this place of ranging is quite a good place to practise some smaller day trading positions. Current PA for$SPYlooks like we rejected off the 4100 as I mentioned quite nicely. Have already flipped into some puts. For Crypto, we look to be developing a wedge on$BTC. You can play the resistance at 16800-16900 and the support at 16100-16300 for a few scalps I think the next couple of days. Also selling CFDs on SOL/USD.I have switched to XM on MT5 currently for my day trading account using CFDs (Essentially the same thing as Futures but i'll do a video on this soon).

      <content>12th December 2022 Update:Current Positions are a$BTCshort and$TSLAlong. I almost always only trade$BTCfor Crypto.Do note, this is my speculative account which I only started with 1000 USD in December after the FTX crash. Aiming to get this to 10000 USD in a month or so. No fixed timeline. Follow at your own risk. This account is for my degeneracy.I am also doing bear call spreads and perhaps credit spreads with my larger main account with options. I‚Äôll share on that later.Current Price targets for$BTC:Short-Term: 15.9k-16.3k SupportLong-Term: 8-12k SupportCurrent Price targets for$TSLA:Hoping to form a swing failure bottom and push for the $210 area. Tight trailing SL here. This could change with CPI Data as well as the FOMC hearing soon.</content>

      <content>Starting Balance 10/12: 1000 USDCurrent Balance 12/12: 2000~ USDClosed off yesterday's BTC Short from 17.2k for a nice profit ($528 USD, 1st Image). Currently on a long from 16.8k (2nd Image) as I expect a dead cat bounce once US Markets open just based on the SPY E-Minis having some upwards pressure.Actually closed open and closed these trades closer to the the top and bottom than it looks. Do note that the buy/sell spread is about 0.001%. Wasn't a perfect exit as I am still getting used to the spreads on CFDs.This might not sound great at first but with CFDs, I don't mind the wider spread cause there are zero commission and fees and markets are less wickish as compared to futures. Also I don't trust CEXs right now. I'll do an exchange/derivative comparison overview for my next video.</content>

      <content>Short-term target for$BTCstill think we need to tap and watch the 15.9k-16.3k Support. If that breaks, we go into goblin town. However, I don't expect the long term support at 8-12k to be reached so soon. Based on my extension models, I think more likely to be in Feb-June 2023. As of now, these are just good setups to swing trade.</content>

      <content>Pardon for the lack of updates recently here! But volumes are just so low in Dec that there's just not much high probability & high RR (risk-to-reward) trade setups, especially if you trade Futures.But here's anoutlook on EUR/USDwhere it looks like it may give a final tap at critical levels of 1.07 before going down for a pullback in this macro bullish leg.But at the end of the day, what we are all trading now really just depends on inflation and wage prints so take this opportunity when market is quiet to read up on these things!</content>

      <content>JUST IN TODAY: Consumer Price Index (CPI) Y/Y: 6.5% , accurate to analysts' expectations.As a result, we are seeing some bullish momentum in the markets right now but negligible as this CPI print may have already been priced in with all the bullish price action we have been seeing recently. (The only scenario the market was going down is if CPI came in higher than expected).Still, the markets have just been going up too heavily without any healthy pullbacks so i'm expecting the environment to turn bearish for awhile soon. Might be a good time to start hunting for short set-ups.</content>

      <content>Forex EUR/USD outlookI think everyone probably knows by now that Market is bullish. But as I've mentioned in the previous weeks, the bulls currently seems to be getting weaker & weaker, especially in EUR/USD. & there's just no nice levels to long from at the moment imo.So this might be a week where I start getting into counter-trend shorts (If there's strong confirmation) & potentially holding these positions for awhile, possibly catching the entire down move of a macro pullback, which has been long overdue. (But ofc, always take partial profits on the way down to secure some bread!)Trade Forex with me here:XM</content>

      <content>For EUR/USD, bulls are starting to show signs of exhaustion here, even with the favourable PCE news today.How do we tell? Traders can make use of candlestick patterns on the chart. For eg if we see multiple wicks beyond a certain point, it is an early sign of a possible reversal as the market isn't strong enough to push price impulsively to close beyond a certain level. (Of course, will still need other confluences to strengthen your bias)But anyways an update, in our selected zone on Jan 16th, 3 clean short setups were available (but weren't taken due to CNY events..)  Still macro bullish though, so taking partial profits/trailing SL is recommended for any counter trend shorts now.Trade Forex with me here:XM</content>

Think we might continue this move to the end of the week but we will probably tease the golden cross before a short breakdown on the shorter-term.Crypto by normal volatility standards actually increased much less than the other assets.

      <content>With all the momentum going up, will be switching my bias back to longs for EUR/USD & looking for price to revisit 1.08-1.09 areas to enter long to take out the target high.Some quick short setups were still available yesterday but would have got stopped out early if quick partials weren't taken (I got stopped out at BE too). That's why its tricky trading counter-trend for many & only recommend it if one has strict discipline in managing their stop losses!Trade Forex with me here:XM</content>

      <content>EUR/USD showing a strong bearish chain. Will look for a quick short from the latest supply zones should we get choch confirmation on the lower time frames / a sweep of liquidity then choch.I think we eventually hit 1.05 but the move down may not be so soon as we might also see a temporary relief up from this 0.79 level first. Either ways, will trade with the trend & just manage the position tightly for now.Trade Forex with me here:XM</content>

      <content>US JAN. CORE PCE PRICE INDEX RISES 4.7% Y/Y; EST. 4.3%A lot to digest from but i'll try to break it down. Basically what this means is that we have to either keep rates sustained at 25 bps for longer (while implies prolonged pain & a slower drawdown). If we push up to 50 bps, this would be disastrous - when the rhetoric has now been to try keep at 25 bps and aim for a soft landing.My best bet is that it keeps the 25 bps hike but Powell suggests to raise the 2% inflation target & we just have to begin accepting higher prices and the destruction of our savings.</content>

      <content>Currently in this simple long set-up after the choch with quick profits taken. 20% of my position left on the table (SL shifted to breakeven), might just leave it running to see if PMI tmr can push it all the way to our target high! (Or 1.062 is an ok level too to start taking final TP)But price action don't look the best atm - feels like may go lower to mitigate the re-entry zones. This is why it's so impt to know your in-trade management & know how to manage your positions when you're in one.Never just blindly follow a signal..Trade Forex with me here:XM</content>

      <content>Nothing too clean to look at for Forex atm so maybe just some quick thoughts on Crypto.Both BTC & ETH are struggling to close bullish above previous highs on the higher time frame charts & that tends to signify to me that bulls are either out of strength and we are ready to go down for awhile OR we are due for one final spike up to liquidate retail investors before a big dump.Atm 21.2k to 20.9k is critical for BTC to hold & ETH's is at 1.5k. Any lower, we can expect further dumps (Looking at 18.2k & 1350 respectively.)When will it happen? Who knows (but FOMC on march 21-22 does look interesting ü§´ Unless Jobs & wages report in the next few days comes in really hot/cool)Trade Crypto CFDs:XM</content>

      <content>Pardon my colloquial speaking, sharing this for learning purposes. Had a friend earlier ask me if it's still worth to short here. At the prices earlier today, I argued that it would be better off selling direct puts for$TSLAat 135-140. Of course, this depends on the time frame you are looking at. To have such sufficient premium, these credits have to be accrued over a much larger time frame. However, with FOMC coming up next week (May 2) I would either ladder in slowly, and stack there depending on the data.In other news, I will be doing some basic trading group lessons for free next month just to collect some testimonials but this will be limited slots for now due to my time constraints. (ps. I am also still learning as I go alongüôÇ)</content>

      <content>What is ADP and is it significant towards the upcoming Govt NFP data?Generally ADP is a smaller sample sized benchmark to the upcoming NFP data. Historically, ADP has come in lower 9/11 times compared to NFP. With this figure 142k about the forecast, this foreshadows another NFP beat. To put things rudimentarily, if the job market is still strong, this gives Powell leeway to hike once more into the FOMC, however I don't think it will be more than the 25 basis points into the 5.25 FFR forecasted tomorrow. Likely just a longer slower bleed, we will keep staying at this range till something breaks.</content>

      <content>How do we trade FOMC tomorrow?As always, the guidance is more important. If he pushes the rhethoric for longer sustained rates and opts to not pause (I think this possibly happens given the NFP data), we get a push down to low 400s on$SPYand heavier drawdowns on growth stocks. It's important to note tech, growth and banking sectors are not correlated. Higher rates might still be beneficial for bigger banks contingent if firesales and bailouts keep happening as we recently saw. Don't think crypto or gold crashes, floor is clearly established barring no black swan event.Still doing bullish spreads or outright spot holdings on Gold as I think we are in a ranging kangaroo market, no point going heavy leverage here.Also like bearish credit spreads on$QQQ, I think there's more premiums as compared to$SPY.Will live trade tomorrow.</content>

      <content>How do we approach CPI?CPI tomorrow should probably still read high, just like NFP. I still think we have a ways to go before interest rate hikes end. However, this doesn't make the idea of a soft landing impossible. So far, it looks like the FEDs are threading this fine line carefully and markets are holding up. Best way to take advantage of this with least stress is still credit spreads in this kangaroo market. Don't think equities go much much higher than this for now. Still at resistance and earnings are over so not much headwinds or big news barring a black swan event.</content>

      <content>Generally, I think a slightly lower than expected CPI number is mildly bullish for equities cause it implies a possible slowdown of rate hikes. However, the number is still too high. Today's movement should be faded back to pre-CPI levels, think$BTCpossibly retests down to 27.6k minimally then we watch that level. I still think Bitcoin and Gold will hold around these price levels. Good for scalps. If we get another chance at a 24-25k$BTCthat level is crucial,$XAUprobably holds steady here.</content>

      <content>Historically, I don't see BTC in the same vein as Gold, BTC is too volatile to be considered a safe haven asset, and it correlates very strongly with the indices. So Inflation up, Equities down, BTC down/muted, Gold up. With today's lower than expected inflation, Equities up, BTC up/muted, Gold down. As always, FED guidance is more important.

      <content>Why I still think credit spreads are good if you are aiming for a chill way to grow your portfolio. I think the rate that inflation is going down is still slow, given the geopolitical headwinds, and their lack of ability to provide stimulus anymore if the FEDs are aiming for a soft landing. It's unlikely we see significant volatile bullish momentum to the upside, If anything it's just a slow grind.Still same levels for$BTC&$SPY, looking at these 2 today.</content>

      <content>As you can see from my previous assessments above; we fade the FOMC day by going bearish neutral with credit spreads. Of course with CPI data today, you could continue bearish neutral and still be profitable but I employed more direct short selling for more profits as I think we stayed at this region long enough.

I am still in my 3/6 Months$GLDGold Bull Put spreads of course. I am not entirely sure on the rhetoric of$BTCas a safe haven asset as I mentioned but I like gold.If you scroll up, I also correctly assessed the boring range last month so I did make through my credit spreads as well, albeit not as much. Also, the$TSLAshort from $200 to $148 move was my most profitable trade which I also closed above. Not 100% executed optimally, but profits are profits. We move on to the next trade.</content>

      <content>Just got our PPI & Unemployment numbers - both shows signs that inflation is slowing and with unemployment greater than forecast, we do have more spare capacity. To be fair, these are m/m which means inflation is of course still stick and ever present. We have FOMC Waller speaking later but I don't think we move much, still holding on to my positions. Nothing too surprising today!</content>

      <content>Understand this is an ungodly hour, but the trick to trading is to be awake or pay attention during market close or open! You notice that reversal was right before US market close - so it's important to take note of session opens and closes as well. You also can see from the telegram history i'm not trading every single day. Times that you are not trading are times you should rest tbh.</content>

      <content>A very very key region of support would be 24.2k - 24.5k, I would potentially bid there if we get there.These are not exact numbers and we have to wait for the day itself but these are 2 examples of setups with a 1:2 R:R, always aiming for positive expectancy. I think both options have possibility of it playing out.</content>

      <content>If we assess this flush to 25k we can see it hit perfectly the 1.618 extension of your first A Wave from 28.3k if you believe in the Elliot Wave theory, however I don't think it's validated yet cause this is such a short timeframe and so wickish. Just closed some there out of caution and considering it was close to the US market close!</content>

      <content>Good close on the$BTCpositions there! Already closed majority.Switching my attention to$SPYtoday as we got a massive miss on theEmpire State Manufacturing Index (Index: -31.8 vs -3.7 expected vs +10.8 April!). This is an extreme reading, and, ultimately, another signal that the markets are getting weaker and weaker. This generally is bearish on the DXY and in turn, Crypto should head higher in the short-term!</content>

      <content>We have a BIG day today. Powell speaking 2 hours after the market opens. It really speaks to how centralised the financial system is given how dependent we are on sentiments right now. I don‚Äôt think they would want to spook the markets too much given how fragile the banking system is.Probably the same rhetoric that financial conditions are sufficiently tight, inflation is coming down, and they remain nimble.RSI on$QQQis above 70+ now,$VIXsuper low, and also$DXYand$SPY/$QQQare both trending up strongly.I think the play here is to wait for$XAU&$BTCto reach the support levels and place buys with SLs. You can also do a call ratio back spread on$VIXor$UVXYas insurance on the main portfolio since it is sufficiently low as well.Looking at1943 - 1935 for$XAU24.8k - 23.8k for$BTC15-14 for$VIXWider range because the ATR for these counters are pretty high, but the R:R for upside is definitely there!</content>

      <content>we are back down! if you are more risk averse, apply a back ratio call spread on$VIXor a mid-term bear call spread on$SPYis not the worst here.for the latter, i think something like buy call 440-445 & sell call 435-440 is a safe/conservative approach. for expirations, i would put them away from big news/earnings day cause you don't want the IV that comes with that.</content>

      <content>Still not much movement, the last time they had a debt ceiling stalemate iirc was in 2013, but the US has never defaulted on its' debt. It will be raised. However, the narrative they push with the FOMC minutes and PCE index on how they are tackling debt and inflation will be more telling on market direction. As of now, at least to me, equities are overbought and gold is oversold!</content>

      <content>PCE inflation, the Fed's "preferred inflation gauge," RISES to 4.4%, above expectations of 3.9%. This is a major setback to the Fed's fight against inflation.A few weeks ago, no one was expecting further IR hikes but as we can see and as I mentioned, inflation is still sticky. I still think eventually there will be more rate hikes and a good correction to get in on stocks so not too worried at the moment. Still DCA-ing on my gold spreads!</content>

      <content>Just want to add that this is a tech rally spurred by a few big names: AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, which is why the tech index performed so well, a lot of other names are still down. This is really bad breadth. Additionally,$QQQis within 1% of its 61.8% fib (golden ratio) from Nov:21 top, $405, to Oct:22 bottom, $260.Why does this matter? The 2000 & 2008 bear markets rallies both stalled at their respective 61.8% fib retracements! ü§îA lot is based on the debt ceiling decision! There are still warning signs (sticky inflation, regional banking crises, consumer spending slowdown, credit card balance building, etc) despite this bullish rhetoric (AI).</content>

      <content>A writeup on the debt ceiling talks.Inflation is still high and will remain stickier if we raise the debt ceiling, however it is necessary to ensure the US functions.What I think will happenRepublicans & Democrats stall the decision to the last minute, eventually raising ceiling.Raising the ceiling has already been priced in so expect this to be a buy the rumour, sell the news situation. Just a quick dip then market resumes trend up slowly.On the small chance, they delay to the point ratings drop, expect a more significant drop. Recall 2011 (Image Attached) The greatest risk on US debt is not the Default, it has not happened before as they can keep shifting the goal post. The greatest risk is the debate taking too long and the credit rating go down.Eventually though, I expect subsequent FOMC rate hikes to dip the market a little, but the real damage is on small banks and mortgages - more defaults and bailouts would be the one that causes a more significant drop later on.</content>

      <content>Side Note: Not all of these are great R:R, I was just experimenting between Credit & Debit Spreads and trying to calculate the Greeks if the positions are worth it. I think$BTCis mid-term bullish, Equities$SPYshort-term bullish, next big date is probably FOMC.I am alsopurchasing some US bondsto try. You might be wondering, are bonds just for boomers? I don't believe so. I think having some cash equivalent is good in this market conditions as we're not going to hyper rally anyway given the yield curve is still inverted imo. We're not trying to make money off the yields but on the face value of the bond. I believe Bond Valuations are low and we are reaching a pause in hikes soon, with easing conditions, rates pause/drop, yields drop, bond prices will spike. Given I am not putting a 6 digit sum, and I don't think everyone has 6 digits to casually throw around, I am looking into bond funds (i.e. PIMCO, SEI, VWESX). Alsoincreasing exposure on my Chinese Equitiesslowly on another account! Still optimising my portfolio allocation and practising some QF.</content>

      <content>Likewise on$BTC, it is somewhat correlated to$SPY, it has a high correlation depending on the narrative. If it is a IR related news event or a M2 money supply related I think they correlate. However, if it relates to financial system breakdown there is some dissonance.If this does not make sense to you, it's okay. We bid 26.8 - 27.1k, next leg I believe is up. Even at absolute worst, there is support at 25k. I suggest not to be highly levered as the ATR on$BTCis huge.Both of these trades are quite speculative as we have no way of knowing when the debt ceiling will be signed. If you want a sure-er way of making money. Just sell cash covered puts for both or waiting for the supports to buy instead of trying to short.</content>

      <content>$BTCdown to 26.8k - 27.1k as I mentioned earlier and$SPYalready being pushed down on ES/US500 futures. I also made additional profits from my$SPYcash covered puts not assigning, I generally put them below supports and I further try to time them by calculating daily ATR/IV to make sure they don't get assigned unless I really want them to.I did strikes 418, 415, 411 on 30/5, 31/5 and 02/6 respectively. First one has already expired without assigning and I re-opened 411 right after that closed. These are just meant to close my short and average to a better entry/hedge the position.Will be putting all my trades on excel and doing livestreams soon. Just relocating right now! I am exploring soybean/copper futures now but more so for experimenting, not to trade with size - my mainstays will still be equities and crypto.</content>

      <content>Think my trades the last year have been all good if you scroll yourself yourself and have been here awhile - fully transparent! Just fairly downsized (on most days)- actually practising proper risk management now. IF you want to follow along and use leverage/margin do so at your own risk. I can stomach losses cause this is within my means. It's all at the end of the day: risk management & positive expectancy. Be back in the US open later!</content>

      <content>Gold pushing to 1965 right now, will layer off some now.There's a different strategy for different derivatives. On my options account, I do debit/credit spreads,large swing plays ONLYas I cannot close in after hours such as now, however, since I benefit from decay I am not concerned with smaller swings outside of US hours. That being said Gold has a lot of movement even in London hours, rarely in Asian hours.For my CFD accountI do strict buy/sell as I am able to close at any time of the day.To put things simply: there is a core/satellite portfolio & we further subdivide according to derivatives and assets.- For Options (Swing Trading): WeBull/ToS/IBKR(Equities/GLD/Buy & Hold)https://www.webull.com.sg/i/sgseowie- For CFDs (Day Trading): XM(XAU Gold only, now exploring Silver/Soybeans/WTI)I don't bother with US500 here, no liquidity on non-US hours.www.xm.com/gw.php?gid=209620- For Crypto Futures: TooBit(BTC/ETH Futures only)https://www.xm.com/gw.php?gid=209620</content>

      <content>Support at1949-1951for$XAU. Close shorts flip into longs there. I normally close before the High Volume Node and wait for guppy/technicals flip. All fluid!London session will likely form a base support for gold. With US equities continuing to drawdown, I expect gold to relief back up in the US Session. Probably a risk-on/risk-off scenario.$BTCdoes not play on this narrative. I think$BTCslowly decouples as a risk asset later on this year and goes up for the next leg.</content>

      <content>US Markets are opening in about an hour! Everything green ‚úÖ again! Everyday, I am trying to sell covered puts as close as possible to the daily low with limit orders, I do so to hedge positions and try not to get assigned.To do this I set limit orders on the sell puts which I calculate the option price based on how much it should move based on Delta and other greeks. If they assign, so be it. I close my short. Otherwise, I wait for my limit buy orders to hit!So far all the last 5 trades across BTC, SPY, Gold look good! I have 6 accounts actually, so i'll share more on my portfolio allocation in later updates/videos.</content>

      <content>$SPYshorts & bear call spreads doing well. Okay in hindsight, the sell put 415 was quite dumb but considering all the CC puts I sold the last 3 days, I get 0.35 credit for it. If I am forced to close it and get assigned today, it does make me close at 415 - 0.35 = 414.65, which is also my TP area.

      <content>Warning when trading news, if you do this - it is quite easy to trade if you can interpret the data fast; in terms of strength & subsequent move.Generally if you have access to Bloomberg terminal, you can assess news/data the second it comes out. The last prop firm and bank I worked at, I was able to take advantage of this. For retails, your next best bet would be to use Twitter/refresh forex factory.Faster data doesn't automatically mean better entry anyway; as market can wick both sides on the second news drops. You are generally 15-30s later on your own but still fast enough then most other retails imo.For instance, this debt ceiling move is very largely already priced in but I think dollar cools off here these next few days. I would not day trade this particular news. Also, asian hours now so it's weak!</content>

      <content>There will be a lot more forced selling & all you need to do is stay abreast of which coins are going to be delisted.Cardano, Polygon, and Solana already delisted by Robinhood (16 hours ago), along with Matic, Ada, Solana with Coinbase (24 hours ago)... Very clear the SEC means business now. Not spreading FUD but I think most of these coins don't recover. I am only a believer in Bitcoin/Eth long-term personally for me - I don't care for L2s or Alts.</content>

      <content>A lot of news this morning I need to update but I think these are important. The SEC is also re-defining the lines of their credit rating references. They've done this previously with inflation definitions ("changing calculations") and recession guidelines ("2 consecutive quarters"). What does this tell me?Either they are already poised for a downgrade given their irresponsible QE and debt ceiling upgrades and are front running the impact possibly.In addition, to CPI, FOMC, and the TGA refill draining liquidity. I might be wrong, but I still stand by my stance that it is risk-off for the markets here at least for the near-term.Source:SEC changes Credit Rating Terms</content>

      <content>One thing I am watching very closely is the XRP lawsuit. I think how it is defined as a security on the context of Howe's Law may allow crypto to run-up. This lawsuit will set the precedence for regulatory actions regarding crypto, allowing for a run-up after this drama subsides. I rather be reactive than predictive - most retail are too slow to catch the run-up anyway or too fast to catch the falling knife. Once news is out, I'll decide.Source:XRP Lawsuit</content>

      <content>Still holding on to$BNBshorts; I think one thing to note is that Binance holds 70-80% of circulating supply and they might need to dump some holdings to insure deposits.I am unsure how they operate but I am almost certain all Crypto Exchanges operate unscrupulously in some capacity, they are likely lending out your deposits in T-Bills/Collateralizing it in Stables. Floor can be deep on this so not taking profits yet, just trailing very distant stops. Can't hold this forever due to funding though...I'll make a bold claim and say Binance will not be allowed back into the US anymore and that absence of market liquidity coupled with their self-inflated price as they are the only MM will make it so we don't see ATH on this anymore.Join me trading at Toobit</content>

      <content>Inflation came out 4.0, 0.1 under expectations of 4.1. Still I think core inflation with housing & food is much stickier. These numbers to me don't mean much.Clearly analysts knew inflation would be coming down hence the run-up recently. Doesn't detract from the fact that the breadth of this market is still very very bad. I expect it to retrace still so holding on to my bear put spreads and selling calls on my portfolio positions - Won't be buying calls here. June to September are also historically bad months for equities/crypto.A likely pause this FOMC but still cautious of hawkish guidance from the FEDs as well as quadruple witching! Should still have volatility this week!</content>

      <content>Powell speaks now, with a tinge of Volckerism.Inflation is indeed slowing and they can afford to be more data-driven but we are still far from 2% where things are. I still believe there is a technical dip coming and that dip is the one worth buying. Perhaps even smaller caps (Russell 2000) as we trickle down and cool off from the Top 7 Megacaps down to the laggards.</content>

      <content>Fed's Powell:"We are watching CRE carefully... I do expect there will be losses in commercial real estate"I think conditions will not ease until 2024. This pause is just meant to aid the TGA liquidity dump and protect banks, it needs markets to run higher.The playbook for fomc meetings once again is to fade the initial news (unless unexpected) once powell speaks it reverses and then fade it again after it closes.Generally just a whipsaw and spike in volatility; which is why we long vega & do debit spreads or consider straddles.</content>

      <content>Once again, this is an extreme stretch, but if we ever do get a black swan event and Binance truly fails - look for the long-term support at 8-12k.Back in December we wish we bought more at those same 15.9 - 16.3k levels.I have traded Crypto for 7 years since my old Bitmex days, and before that OTC - You never know with Crypto, as it's pursuant to too many regulatory forces trying to shut it down (from Mt Gox, to Bitmex, to Luna, to 3AC, to FTX). It is after all, anti-government, anti-establishment, anti-FED & an extremely leveraged/speculative market. Yet one thing it is, is that it is scarce, and when it rallies, it rallies.Make sure you have ammo for disaster if it happens.Don't expect but always prepare for these events.</content>

      <content>A year ago,at 60k, I targeted 15-18k for buys on Bitcoin & shorted all the way down almost perfectly adding on each wave up. (If y'all recall I was posting 5-6 Digits Live PnL quite often then)12th December 2022I called to buy 16.3k and after the first impulse wave I targetted 25k, then adrawdown to 20kand themove to 30k.All tradeslogged here.Last Month, at 30k, I said to watch forsupportat 23-25k, we're here now!Only thing I can say now is that we truly go to shit, it is if Binance fails, Regulatory Blanket Bans, and/or Systemic Token Failure but doesn't change my long-term view of Crypto so i'll bid still at every support cause i'm laddering really slowly. I even said a year agoif we hit 8-12k it's in March - June 2023.(I think this is extremely unlikely) & time models are largely inaccurate (so should be taken with a pinch of salt). I think we get our rally in2025-2027, when conditions ease, so if that's your long-term timeframe, all good.All there, unedited if you scroll up.</content>

      <content>Many countries are now pausing, while China is full-on easing monetary conditions, I think this posits a strong possibility China markets run-up. The markets yesterday called Powell's bluff, historically (90% of the time, except 1981 with Paul Volker FED Chair) after it pauses it tends to remain paused. However, countries like the UK had to backpedal on this and hike rates in subsequent meetings.Personally, I still enjoy holding my holdings in SGD, cause we have gradual modest appreciation with our$SNEERlines. However, we can't appreciate too heavily or we will be uncompetitive with our exports.Source:China cuts rates.</content>

      <content>Gave the numbers more thana month ago! I called the bottom onGold (1935), Bitcoin (24.8), and VIX (14). All 3!The one thing I did not expect was$VIXto be so manipulated. Historically, VIX has been used by traders to hedge portfolio positions. This is my first time in my 7 years of trading (and apparently more) that VIX has gone down with SPY going up, and vice versa. I have a theory on this that this is due to the introduction of 0DTEs, which mess up the put call parity, as well as the volatility. Hence, making this run-up on equities both overextended and so beyond the Bollingers, and other extension models.Yes, you can argue with me "it's AI", I think this is purely manipulation where funds keep prices up while buying 0DTEs, crushing volatility while keeping up. It WILL eventually rug. However, I do not have information on what funds are doing, all I know is that when they pull the plug - it's gonna be a nasty drop.</content>

I expect liquidity to drain from TGA and spread into smallers caps - looking at Dow Jones & Russell to reallocate my portfolio later on these few months. My long dated bear spreads are barely just positive already. Also why I chose to do bear spreads instead of direct puts if you saw above. This strategy alone saved my portfolio given how crazy this tech runup has been.$XAU, gold in mild bearish trend but I don't believe we break much lower,1800-1870is a huge demand zone and inflation is still high like it or not ‚úåüèº</content>

I still see gold at ATH by next year, but this is probably the slowest moving asset without leverage. As of now, I am accumulating both gold,  bitcoin and small cap etfs.Going to be a largely muted week with today being the US holiday. Thursday has more high impact news with unemployment claims, ISM & FOMC Minutes but I doubt this is a narrative changing week. Cautiously Bullish still!</content>

      <content>While the US Debt Ratings Downgrade is concerning, other indicators are still pointing towards a strong economy. This weeks PMI and Jobs Report numbers will be indicative of that and slow down this drop in my opinion.However, we're coming into the weaker months of the year based on seasonality, I expect a short-lived downtrend the next couple of months.I believe tech ($TSLA,$NVDA) is grossly overvalued right now, but I don't want to short against irrationality. Hence, I will just be trading gold$XAUdown to 1905-1920. I believe crypto market cap in general will be muted and ranging, but alts will go down more, and I can see$ETHgoing down to 1720-1730 support.Trade on XM here for $500 Deposit Extra:XM National Day Promo</content>

      <content>1850-1890is a great point to start laddering into the$RUT(Russell 2000) for long-term investing. I believe the wider breadth might reduce your down-side risk.However, personally right now I am on a small short on equities but I am selling Cash-covered puts on$SPYfor $420-425 for about $2 credit for 15th September for the long-side. Not effectively delta neutral but decay is in my favour.Credit taking however is not exceptionally great here due to Implied Volatility not being high. Rudimentarily this means we're not in an exceptionally volatile environment, i.e. there is some market indecision. Hence, premiums and a credit-taking strategy is not exceptionally favourable here.Trade on XM here for $500 Deposit Extra:XM August Promo</content>

I will take a short hiatus to look to scale some of these up.In actuality, it is not just the ideas that makes the trade.

      <content>Watch 1959 on$XAUGold & 29.1 - 29.4k on$BTC. Probably see some slow continuation here before we drop backdown - this is just a bearish retest. I don't see any more major move to the upside in the next 1-2 months frankly. Still think that last US Credit Ratings drop was a pivotal point that we are going into some hawkish/headwind months.The fact that jolts jobs data (lowest job opening since Sept 2021) and consumer confidence just fell so much implies that the economy is not that strong, you also have to consider the lag effect.

      <content>As I mentioned, I think the US Credit Ratings Drop, followed by the Jackson Hole speech is indicative of the short-term Hawkish environment. Cooling cursory inflation data negates the need for rate hikes, but this weakening jobs data could posit a 2nd round of hikes.Bitcoin & Gold are highly sensitive to rising US Interest Rates, the latter more specifically, as these increase the opportunity cost of holding - why speculate on gold when you can get safe and high return from higher yields from higher rates.These are very speculative. However, I can see$XAU, gold dropping slowly to at least 1850(Possible HTF Pennant). Similarly with$BTC, Bitcoin,a full extension drop will bring us to 23.9 - 21.2k(Possible HTF Swing Failure Bottom).I am cautiously bearish. With these, we also have to consider the contagion effect of the re-emerging Evergrande Crisis; accounting for 30% of Chinese GDP, a default would possibly require a Chinese Government Bailout.Source:China Evergrande Crisis Part 2</content>

      <content>Still bearish on$BTCand$XAU- as I said, just a bearish retest!That Bitcoin rejection was way faster than I thought, but I think gold's drop will be much slower. If we get to those levels - and you should be making money if you have been following - you should be buying back heavily with those profits. That's what I will be doing! Those levels are crucial to watch. For now, just holding shorts down.</content>

      <content>I would be looking for CPI and FOMC to fade the news. Think the rate hike is already priced in, dollar should slow down it's strength and gold will rally soon.

      <content>CPI printed hotter than expected, raising rate hike expectations for November. This is significant as many expected a cool print given how long rates have been this high. Markets will probably cool off into September's FOMC meeting which should not be a rate hike still.</content>

      <content>Looking at a short-term pullback and a swing failure top to bring us down to B. I believe 429 - 436  should be the real demand zone for$SPY. I still believe it's a moderately bullish market in the mid term as I have come to accept J Powell can't risk collapsing the stock market. Unless we get a Debt Crisis or the Real Estate Market Imploding we should slowly chop up around November-December.</content>

      <content>Just to be clear I think dollar strengthens since inflation is hot and we are going to get more rate hikes through till the end of the year.Funds should start going risk off as they repo their portfolio and take profits from all the tech gains (Just like Jensen Huang). Currently - BTC and Equities still bearish, Bullish gold in the short term.Long run, I think everything still goes up because the inflation machine is still strong and everything is going to be propped up.</content>

      <content>I will put a very tight trailing SL for$SPYat 441.8 once we break under 440.8. If we break this demand zone convincingly we should get to 437/438 or even lower. However, I believe we are in a bull market still. This move is just flushing out longs/calls, it can overextend down but that dip is still for buying!</content>

      <content>Gold ($XAU) likely see resistance at 1939 - 1941. This is a shorter-term view of the previous attached Gold Chart. I see support on$SPYat 440-441 respectively.Occasionally Gold and SPY will move inversely if it is a risk on/risk off scenario, but they can also move correspondingly if its a major dollar movement since it's the underlying currency they are both pegged too.  It's important to ignore the actual FOMC hike numbers unless they're out of expectations, as usual, the guidance will be more important, and i speculate that there will still be rate hikes proposed in November. Leaning on more upside for$XAUand slightly more downside for$SPY.(Trade with me here on XM)</content>

      <content>Defence Stocks in a New World OrderIf you scroll through my past postings, you guys will realise I have been an advocate for defence stocks likeLMTover the last 2 years. This is up 7% today and steadily rising since Covid.In Ray Dalio's Theories on the Changing World Theory - we often see that world powers dominance are in a cyclical nature. Hyperinflation, Dollar Milkshake Theory, Petrodollar all contribute to how the US weaponises their dollar. In short, it buys oil from the Saudi's essentially for free through incessant printing of USD. At the same time, supplying weapons to the Middle East & Ukraine, 'profiting' from conflict. Even when we eventually de-dollar, or any black swan events happens, one thing is for certain, the US will not go down without a fight.When Russia invaded Ukraine, the stock jumped ~30% in 3 days. Since the start of 2022,$LMTis up ~25% as geopolitical tensions have escalated globally.Trade with me on XM</content>

      <content>To Hike or not to hike?Currently, Markets are priced for no change in rates with the probability at 95%. Once again, the guidance thereafter is more important. I believe that the FEDs cannot afford to cut rates as inflation as I have said for the whole year - is too sticky and inaccurately reported. Housing prices still remain high, and this has long term ramifications on Population Data & Long Run Productivity.My rhetoric remains that we have higher for longer and they will only cut if the current rates break something (i.e Banking ystem, Mortgages, etc). I believe we still see another ersatz run-up on equities.TLDR: Given No Hike. Equities rally into the new year. With the possibility of hikes later on. Cuts only if system breaks.Source:FED holding rates at the highXM News Site:Learn on XM</content>

      <content>Upside still in play. I expect this to be a big fake out and if interest rates rise high enough next year along with a debt crisis, we start seeing cracks in the real estate market/banking sector.Selling covered calls and hedging along the way up using call ratio back spreads on VIX or SQQQ accordingly because we can't predict for black swan events. VIX got a bit destroyed by 0dte so I am looking at different ways to hedge according to the weighted beta of my portfolio.</content>

      <content>Still see upside on US equities as I believe dollar is to weaken and equities chop up towards the end of the year. I think over time the$QQQrally will slow down and disperse over to the$SPYand $RUT2000. A sustained rally requires breadth. Hence, still in all my positions. Only selling covered calls.This equities run-up in my opinion will come at the cost of the USD strength and$DXYseeing new lows as we see other countries dump more US Debt and Treasuries. Just to consider - we have a Santa Claus rally and have an election year coming up in 2024.This is supported by the recent statements by Dr. Ed Yardeni: ‚ÄúWe remain bullish on$SPX, which we expect will consolidate for a few more days before resuming the Santa Claus rally.We are still forecasting 4600 by year-end. A solid break above 4550 gap fill could signal a good start for stocks in 2024.‚ÄùTrade with me on XM</content>

      <content>I would be especially cautious with tech as well as$QQQat these levels. It is heavily skewed with no breadth with the top 7 still leading the indices. Watch NVIDIA's earnings especially closely tomorrow. Generally a rally before earnings smells like exit liquidity for a close reversal soon. 555 for$NVDAis a huge HTF fibo extension and should be respected for resistance if other indicators confluence.

      <content>DXY Daily Chart Pre-FOMCDXY bearish since Q4 and is currently at a D1 demand zone that coincides with the equilibrium level between Q3's range.If the demand zone fails to hold price I expect a continuation of the bearish trend into discount levels at the .618 - .782 region, with the 102.00 psychological level in sights.The bearish dollar this quarter has been fueled by anticipation of rate cuts in the near future as early as Q1 '24.In contrast, XAU/USD is up 10% in the same period. XXX/USD pairs should see a similar bullish rally.Trade with me on XM</content>

      <content>End of week EUR/USDPrice this week pretty much just created a range, with 1.0965 being the high of the week and 1.0852 being the low of the week. The bullish trend continues, with the D1 supply and 1.1000 level in sights.The data from Germany showed that the headline German IFO Business Climate Index improved to 87.3 in November from 86.9 in October. The Current Assessment Index edged higher to 89.4 from 89.2, while the Expectations Index rose to 85.2 from 84.8.Although these figures came in slightly below analysts' estimates, they had virtually no impact on the Euro's valuation. There are still lingering fears of a recession in the Euro zone but the bullish trend continues  for now.Trade with me on XM</content>

We are currently trading in the daily supply zone and we can only look for shorts once price shows bearish confirmations.Other than that longs are still in play, but I will only consider discount regions on the lower timeframes.On the fundamental side of things, the Fed's less hawkish stance continues to support EUR/USD. Fed Governor Christopher Waller mentioned that they may not maintain the high interest rates.Additionally, the decline in US Treasury yields cited as an additional weakening factor for USD.For EU, Spain and Germany are expected to report a slowing in the annual inflation rate.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR end-of-week analysisAs expected in our scenarios, price has continued to push lower after the daily supply mitigation, and has taken out one of the lows at 1.0852.There are 2 scenarios that we could see in the coming week.1st scenario: Price continues bearish, taking out the second key low at 1.0825 and fills the imbalance on the 4HR chart.2nd: scenario: Price retraces back into premium levels to fill the fair value gap above, before continuing the bearish pressure to the 4HR imbalance/demand zone below.On the fundamental side of things, easing inflation numbers fueled speculation that central banks will refrain from hiking rates further. The focus shifts to US NFP data next week.For the EU, the Euro weakened amid rumors suggesting the pause in Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) reinvestments leading to the end of the year due to low liquidity.Financial markets are pricing in a first ECB rate cut in April.Trade on XM</content>

Even though its an election year I still headwinds and the possibility of blackswan events coming into 2024. Times are still shifty.

With NFP coming up, there are 2 possible scenarios for price.The first scenario, price continues the bearish trend into the 4HR demand. If this happens I will wait for lower time frame confirmations before taking longs.The second scenario, price retraces up into the 1HR supply zone which coincides with the higher timeframe equilibrium levels. From there we could look to take high probability shorts. to target the 4HR demand zone.Trade on XM</content>

I still expect price to continue bearish into the 4HR demand at 1.0700.After the 4HR demand mitigation we have to wait for the release of the interest rates.

As Referenced fromSPY July 2023 Trading PlanWe got our A-B-C move, now we look for D. Have to still validate the Elliot Waves using Fibonacci Ratios and Stochastic Oscillators.Wave 2 and Wave 4 will alternate. If wave 2 is a sharp correction, Wave 4 is a flat correction and vice versa. Since we got a relatively sharp correction for Wave 2, I presume this will be a flatter one.</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR analysisPrice is still in this range, with the weak high yet to be mitigated. We also have equal highs currently and I expect the bullish momentum to continue until 1.100After price takes out those highs, we could look for shorts down to target the lows below as well as the 4HR imbalanceWe have US GDP Q/Q and unemployment claims released later today. I anticipate numbers to be worse than expected.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR AnalysisThe Euro continued the bullish rally after yesterdays' US GDP and manufacturing data coming in worse than expected.As anticipated in our scenarios price has taken out the key level at 1.100. There are 2 possible scenarios as of now.First scenario is that if price retraces down into discount levels and the 4HR imbalance, we could look for longs targeting the highs at 1.106.The second scenario is that if price creates a reversal on the lower timeframes, we could look for shorts to target liquidity at the lows near the equilibrium level at 1.093.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR weekly recapTechnicalsPrice was bullish the whole week. As expected we had the 4HR weak high and swing high taken out. We have also have liquidity building for future shorts. The 4HR imbalance from last week has yet to be filled. Volume was much lower compared to last week.FundamentalsMost of the volume this week came in after US GDP and unemployment claims came out on Thursday, followed my US Core PCE inflation data on Friday. Both numbers came in worse than expected, leading to bearish sentiment for USD.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>EURUSD 4HR analysisPrice rejected off the 4HR supply and retraced back down into the 4HR imbalance as anticipated previously. If price shows signs of a reversal on the 1HR/15m we could look for longs.Other wise if price continues the bearish trend and breaks below the 4HR demand, we could see the next checkpoint at the 4HR imbalance below around the 1.084 region. We also have liquidity for the move as well.On the fundamental side of things, we have US Job Openings and ISM manufacturing numbers tomorrow, so keep that in mind.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>I have flipped bearish on Equities from$SPYat 475. Looking at tentatively 458 for now.ISM manufacturing PMI just came in at 47.4, above consensus of 47.2. But still in contraction territory. Forget the plunge in quits: hiring was absolutely obliterated in November, and is now far below pre-covid levels. We have FOMC Meeting Minutes in 2 hours!We are seeing hiring freezes across now, I think even in Singapore.</content>

In our forecasts we expected the lows at 1.0900 to be swept and a mitigation of the 4HR imbalance below at 1.082 - 1.085.We pretty much consolidated above the 4HR imbalance but swept liquidity and looking to mitigate the 4HR supply at 1.100The second scenario for next week is that price continues bearish and mitigates the 4HR imbalance along with CPI/PPI news.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>Been awhile since I posted a$BTCBitcoin chart but I believe we retrace further down here to 36.1-36.9k levels very possibly.Just on the basis the SEC ETF granting is a sell the news event, we're at high timeframe high volume node levels, and this is the 1.618 extension of the previous monthly high low range (as shown). My holdings are from 20k and I sold close to 40k so I am not fomo-ing to buy back in just yet. I will be buying back my holdings there! Doing longer term positional trades for crypto now.</content>

      <content>Still waiting for D on$SPY. Just selling weekly covered calls on holdings. No shorts. We are still long-term bullish, no point fading the trend. We're seeing a lot of layoffs and inflation doing a second runup. However, I doubt the FEDs will raise rates and I believe they will only delay cuts. Bond Markets already pricing this in.I generally like to time my sell calls and long vega before high volatility news (i.e FOMC, Jan 30/31). Trying to train myself to build a portfolio rather than just daytrading.</content>

Currently we have 2 scenarios for the end of this month.The first scenario is that price mitigates the  4HR demand in discount (1.0800) levels.

      <content>Waiting for the pull-back to D for$SPYapproximately at 450-460. Starting 1st layer of re-entry at under 460. Should not be that deep of a retracement given fibo/elliot wave models.I do believe we get a melt-up if the FEDs follow through with their rate cuts. However, with regional banks starting to close again ($NYCB) along with BTFP ending in March, I expect the delays in cuts from Powell's more hawkish stance in yesterday's FOMC to pull this market back into consolidation; as I mentioned inflation is not that easily beaten and he is not willing to pivot so early.If we recall from the 1970s-1980s, Volcker did face a 2nd rise in inflation. Election year is a non-factor.</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR end-of week recapPrice has been ranging at the start of this week and became more volatile towards NFP. Yesterday's news gave us a huge 4HR imbalance to fill next week.I expect 2 scenarios early on for next week. First scenario is that price retraces up to fill the 4HR imbalance at around 1.085, before continuing the overall bearish trend.The second scenario is that price continues to be bearish and closes below the 4HR demand without mitigating the 4HR imbalance.Imo taking shorts after price fills the 4HR imbalance at premium levels would be higher probability. Monday's Powell speech and ISM services data will give us the bias for the week.Trade on XM</content>

Those following my Twitter would know I have been loading up!$NIOalso cheap here but high risk.US Market is now pricing in 4 rate cuts instead of 6.

      <content>Very good sell. We're at 74 on$BABAnow. I might reallocate later but i'll sell cash covered puts at the open. I do think banks will be the next play as with the regional banks collapsing, the potential for bailouts and buyouts will present upside on the bigger banks!</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR Analysisprice is currently retracing to the upside since last week. We had a 4HR imbalance from NFP that has yet to be filled. As of now the higher timeframe bias is still bearish.2 scenarios for me. First is that price retraces into the 4HR imbalance, gives lower timeframe confirmations to the downside and we take shorts.Second scenario is that price continues to push lower and closes below the 1.072 region. If that happens, we can continue to take shorts. My bias will be bullish if price closes above the 4HR imbalance.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>EUR/USD 4HR analysisPrice is still bearish on the higher timeframes. We have a 4HR supply caused from Tuesday's US CPI data coming in better than expected.Currently we are in a bullish retracement phase into premium prices. The most likely scenario is price to mitigate the 4HR supply, where we can look for potential shorts to continue the bearish trend.My bias will only be bullish if price closes above the 4HR supply zone.On the lower timeframes I would look for longs to the 4HR supply in premium prices.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>I am beginning to realise we are not going to get a wave down on$SPYfor D. However, if we run straight to E at 525-535, I would honestly be extremely concerned because this smells like manipulation, driven by derivatives, 0DTEs & not a healthy stock market upward movement.It would very likely be a blowoff top with$NVDAin this case likely being 1200-1400 at maximum. Without a pull-back this is actually likely going to be a spectacular liquidation cascade crash downwards after. This would also mean the dollar devalues hard & bonds are dumped.I got stopped out of my US Equities$SPYshort from 502 at small profit & still in my Crypto$BTCshort collecting funding with a SL at BE as well now, same targets.</content>

      <content>Nice bounce off the 0.382 where I closed. I had issues with my limit orders on Toobit as I was not used to it so I had to resort to market orders a lot. As much as FTX has failed me, the FTX UI allowed for greater functionality and creative trading with options and OCO GTC FOK orders. Was a +5k USD on Futures day overall.I still see potential downside on Crypto given how crazy this run-up has been. Trend might change here. However, will look to rebuy the spot I sold in a couple of weeks!</content>

There are currently 2 scenarios for today.1st scenario: Price retraces into the 1HR imbalance before continuing to the downside to mitigate the 4HR imbalance below. (Shorts)2nd Scenario: Price mitigates the 4HR imbalance below, before retracing up to the 1HR imbalance above. (longs)London session will be choppy with all the manufacturing PMI data from the Eurozone.Trade on XM</content>

      <content>Think we potentially get a sweep to 496 and then a final blow off rally at 425 on$SPYbefore a major correction. But the risk:reward on upside is not great on tech at the moment. Looking at bear credit spreads potentially on$NVDAlater as we have reached our 2.618 extension now. Very risky play but I will limit risks with options.Yesterday's FED speech shows a lot of mispricing in the markets:1. S&P 500 is trading like are in a new bull market carried by tech / Regional bank stocks are crashing like the crisis never ended.2. Bonds are rising and dollar is dropping like the Fed is cutting interest rates. / Inflation data is rising like rate cuts are cancelled.3. Bitcoin¬†is rising like there's no recession coming / Gold is rising like a recession is on the way.</content>

      <content>I am looking at 1.2k at the top-end target for$NVDA; that should bring the final$SPYtarget at 525-529 for the full wave I drew since June 2023. The longer it doesn't correct, the more convinced I am we get a strong pullback there. For the time being, rally is strong so I am selling cash-secured puts and holding stocks but rebalancing and selling covered calls.As per Powell's Speech, rates are definitively going to be high for longer but with backdoor easing through the reverse repo market & tga.</content>

      <content>$DXYdropped almost half a percent just today alone. That's huge for currency. If you want to reposition your portfolio into a more stable bet I actually think gold has plenty of upside towards 3k. We have finally broken through the range and trending strongly above the 200 MA. China stocks are also still undervalued but in a bear tightening channel/wedge.The worse thing you can do imo is hold cash given rising inflation and a federal reserve that is more concerned for the elections and buying votes.</content>

      <content>Daylight Savings eastern time will revert back to NY open at 9:30pm Singapore GMT+8 time.Powell's closing remarks which I must highlight is that he sees more banks failing and rate cuts at the end of the year. I am sure policy makers and banking institutions are pressuring him to lower rates at the cost of a devaluing USD.I am almost certain we get fresh lows on the dollar and 5200 on$ES$SPYfor our final wave which means we get a $1000+$NVDA. My gut says we pivot reversal there. I have been correct on a lot of the larger moves over the years if you scroll through the pinned messages.</content>

      <content>Sharing some of my notes I wrote yesterday afternoon on the difference between a bear debit and credit spread on$NVDA. Not refined so might be hard to understand.Delta negative and long vega would imply doing direct puts/debit spread would be more cost efficient than a synthetic short/credit spread with better risk:reward on such a momentum based stock.

      <content>I still see China as undervalued and US as overvalued. Just a possibility is that we get a diverging wedge into a final rally into the end of the year before a major market crash in 2025 after the election year. I think it's entirely a possibility that we get a 2nd run of inflation given this equities rally and the persistent CPI as seen by today.February CPI inflation rate RISES to 3.2%, above expectations of 3.1%.Core CPI inflation fell to 3.8%, ABOVE expectations of 3.7%.This is the 35th consecutive month with inflation above 3% and second straight increase.A Fed pivot is becoming less likely.Once again, I do not recommend trading like me as I am a degenerate and I am just giving my 2 cents.</content>

      <content>Might be crazy but I can see us trending down to 511.23-512.11 to fill the gap on$SPYvery soon. This PPI is the hottest since June 2022. Generally for the last 2 times at least - CPI causes a run-up and then it fades into a dump on PPI. We normally see bullishness on Fridays which tend to be low volatility, that's why we call it VIX crush friday.However, this Friday is slightly special because we have Triple-witching and OPEX tomorrow, coming into it with low volatility. Hence, I think Volatility/Vega spike into it and that tends to be to the downside.$BTCbeing a risk-on asset should also follow and our dollar strength gets a relief rally up. Long-term trend still up as long as we maintain the levels.</content>

I think the real huge high volume node support is 45-48k but I am not sure if we get there.

      <content>$DXYDollar is rallying off the Asian Hours now. I noticed forex pairings have much cleaner lines. With stocks, equities, and crypto you have to be cautious with stop loss hunts such as this move up right now. However, fx lines for dollar strength are cleanly rising.I still believe risk-on trend is down temporarily for the next few weeks as the dollar is strengthening. As I said, might need this whole month after FOMC to find a bottom based on Time arcs & ATR indicators. If we get those$BTClevels I am bidding all-in again.</content>

      <content>This is called a Guppy Flip (GMMA).  Similar to a MA crossover/golden cross - it is bearish when the short-term Moving Average bands crosses the longer-term ones. I set this up on Pinescript on TradingView! (For your learning) When confluenced with the Elders Force Index - it can be predicative of a trend change.

      <content>Trying to be patient with the setups. Sometimes I close earlier out of principle. Such as closing the$BTCBitcoin short at 68.3 and then the flip long from 66.1k earlier at 68.3k, even though I expect it to wick to 69-70k.This applies the same for my$SPYshort, I closed at 509.85 from 518 instead of waiting for 507/508 even though my support levels are there. Currently in$SPYlong from 508.5 targeting 511.9.While the idea would be to maximise profits, I believe in taking profits at a higher probabilistic area and ladder in the flip slightly more extended.</content>

      <content>There will probably be a bounce at 61k, but I believe 46-49k will be the larger point of control/high volume node.

      <content>People always tell me$BTCBitcoin is  a store of value - it's not. No store of value would have this kind of volatility. I have ran through large datasets on bloomberg terminal before. It's a risk asset for now plain and simple. It can change over time with halvenings and less supply would likely cause less volatility over time. By then, your chance to make life-changing money would be gone, we ride the waves of speculation and volatility till I think 2030s.</content>

      <content>Very likely we get the move to 511.9 on$SPYat least, ES & US500 are moving upwards today. However, this move is still in the onset of a relief rally on the$DXY. I think this retracement up is also for shorting. Similar to the move we got with$BTCto 70k previously.300 shares long from 508.5 to 512 should be about 1k USD profits. Might look to divest into$XAUnext. I see opportunity there when dollars devalues back down.</content>

I believe the first move should be faded but this will be a volatile session.Tomorrow is one of the most important FOMC meeting of your life. Why?This FOMC comes with projections, minutes, and guidance. It's also a turning point - as 3 months ago, 90% concensus were expecting cuts in March. What will determine if the Fed's decision is positive or negative for cruptostocks/bonds? Simply...1) How many rate cuts do the dots show for 2024?2) Whether the Fed hints at a rate cut in forward guidance?</content>

      <content>FOMC in 15 Minutes; Expecting a higher for longer hawkish guidance with no rate cuts and a lower projection of cuts expected. They'll say 2 but we might get 1 only at the late end of the year. Bullish momentum still strong though! Only expecting a temporal pullback on risk assets till start of next month, I have stated this prior.Rather than short overvaluation or equities. A safer play would be to do call ratios on a very heavily suppressed VIX or buy shorter-dated puts for insurance.Watch the colour of the Ties. NFA! üòä</content>

      <content>Fed left 3 rate cuts in the dot plot. Risk was they moved to 2. 3 likely means they start in July or Sept & do one each meeting with the exception of one meeting (if they start in July).Markets should be fine, small caps and A.I. stocks should continue higher after this pullback.</content>

      <content>FED Press Conference Post Mortem;Still on track for rate cuts in June. Powell made sure to qualify the Fed's commitment to bringing inflation back down to 2% by repeating that the target would be achieved "over time."  However, he never clarified how much time. Dovish! I think the full crash comes at the tail end of the year upon first cuts. Generally, crashes happen in confluence with the cuts. We run back higher on Crypto and Equities in 1 months time.</content>

      <content>I agree with the first slide's opinion that Powell caved last night to Election year demands. While the rates did not change, the dot plot stayed at 3 and the balance sheet was increased. This is extremely foolish with the Feds assumption that these risk assets inflating will not have a wealth effect that pushes inflation higher.Hence, why I decided to flip on my own accord last night as well. Still bought back cheaper than I sold. The second slide is what can happen if you marry yourself to a trade.</content>

      <content>UOB One Slashes Interest RatesWhy are we getting rate cuts? Is this bullish for the markets?1. UOB One slashing interest rates signals to me that rate cuts are all but priced in. In Singapore, we generally try to have our SIBOR rates and S$NEER line peg to the US FEDs Decisions.2. Election year normally comes with debt forgiveness and fiscal spending to ‚Äúbuy votes‚Äù3. With US debt growing at 33 Trillion and a 5.5% effective FEDs funds rate, the US Government paying 1.6 Trillion in Interest Payments is simply unsustainable for their sheet.4. If we go by the historical trends of yield curve inversions - with our current yield curve steepening. Rate cuts generally coincides with markets crashes. Hence, why I postulate we still get a correction into June when prospective rate cuts are to happen.FEDs are of course still in Catch 22 situation, but they simply HAVE to cut despite not nearly being anywhere near the 2% inflation target- we either move the goalpost, or at the cost of worsening inflation for the consumer/middle class. My nihilism inclines me to believe it‚Äôs the latter.Source:UOB One Slashes Interest Rates</content>

      <content>Let's talk March PMI - What is the Purchasing Manager Index?The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is¬†an index of the prevailing direction of economic trends in the manufacturing and service sectors. It consists of a diffusion index that summarises whether market conditions are expanding, staying the same, or contracting as viewed by purchasing managers.Above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.The ISM Services PMI in the US fell to 51.4 in March 2024 from 52.6 in February and below forecasts of 52.7.With actual lesser than forecast - This generally implies a weak dollar. Preceding Powell‚Äôs speech tomorrow. This can signal a short-term rally this week in US equities, dollar-denominated risk-on assets (i.e. Bitcoin)On the contrarythe China PMI came out to be 52.7 as opposed to 52.5 prior and as forecasted.There is some seasonality here in March. We know why this happens - a quirk of the Chinese calendar. China shuts down in late January or early February for an entire week (Spring Festival). It starts back up again and by March it looks like a boom even when it isn't.Source:Purchasing Manager's Index below Forecast</content>

      <content>Powell speaks in 15 minutes!PMI data just out is indicative of dollar weakness and a risk-on relief rally. Will most likely be a nothing burger. I will likely be closing positions on$BTClongs and scaling shorts for US Equities. Shorting a bull-market is incredibly dangerous but I am generally fast in and out. I believe the month is still bearish or flat coming into June FOMC.Fed Chair Powell is likely to hammer home the message that rate-cuts are coming but not just yet in a keynote address at Stanford University this afternoon. His remarks follow an endless parade of his peers also jawboning market expectations down (successfully) to the point where the market is now more hawkish than The Fed's latest dots.</content>

      <content>Full disclosure. I have about 300k in shorts across$SPY$QQQ$NVDA$PEPE. Smaller margin than I am used to using but this dip has also taken way longer than I expected. I had to cut some size along the way as some of my cash secured puts exercised to close my shorts as well. Happy to still be profitable!

      <content>How do you trade both sides?I have already been leaning bearish this entire month but that did not mean I did not take longs.I did take longs from 508.5 on$SPYand 59k on$BTCafter shorts from 520 and 75k respectively. However, I did close those too early at 513 and 66.6k respecitvely.I did even say I expected them to go higher if you recall but I chose instead to close them at my first TPs instead of waiting for full extension as that's a lower probability/expectancy play. However, I ONLY short on the full extension of the move and not where I close my longs giving me more margin of error. I am also cautious of a liquidity event possibility on Crypto and spoke about this on my LIVE a few days back!</content>

I was one of the crazies who thought we might not get any/or only 1 cut. I could see the bond market diverging from the dot plot. Yesterday, we had the first narrative of no rate cuts being floated around, causing the fastest 30 minutes marking the close with the$NQ$QQQdropping over 1.5% in the last 30 minutes!Source:No Rate Cuts Floated</content>

I also don't expect a trade to go my way immediately so I ladder in during supply zones.Few will tell you but risk management is as important a tool as any in trading.

      <content>I added$PEPEshorts here as I believe we have yet to break the resistance convincingly for$BTC. With halving in the next 2 days I believe to be a non-factor & a sell the news event. Still targeting 55k on$BTCeventually but I prefer to short stupid altcoins as opposed to Bitcoin.This retracement has been stubborn across the board with my$NVDAshorts also still not reaching my target. I am still expecting a small quick dip but the longer we stay here, the more I worried I am this is an extended move down. Generally, the longer we consolidate, the larger the move as more retails get trapped.</content>

      <content>CPI hot for 3 Consecutive MonthsInterest rate futures are now pricing in just 2 interest rate cuts for the entire 2024.This is the first time that markets are pricing-in LESS rate cuts than Fed guidance.Bond Markets are starting to realise. Don't listen to what they say, watch what they do!There will be no rate cuts in my opinion. I've said it before and i'll say it again. My bet is we will see an annualised 4% Inflation Handle in2024/2025once the amazingly low fall 2023 Inflation reads stop dragging the average down.Cue 1970s High Inflation Arthur Burns Era before Volcker came in and stood on business. üë®üèº‚Äçüíº</content>

      <content>Learning Points: Today's scenario of Negative GammaWe have a scenario of Negative gamma today. Short Options have negative gamma (i.e. Sell Call/Sell Put).As we are in NEGATIVE gamma, puts get paid. Once you know where the daily puts are, you know the floor.Don‚Äôt long in a negative gamma environment.Negative gamma (in the S&P 500) basically is a market phenomena where we see increased volatility because options market makers need to sell S&P futures as the market goes lower and buy them as the market goes higher. When futures are priced different from spot that's where we get Contango/Backwardation and Funding/Swaps/Etc aims to correct this.Gamma squeeze is a different phenomena. A gamma squeeze is when we have a confluence of:1) short-dated OTM long calls being bought by traders2) option volume (notional) is a substantial component of the underlying volume, e.g., the ratio of option volume to notional underlying volume is significant and not close to 0.</content>

      <content>Japan reaches an all-time low against the DollarYen has reached 35 year all time low against the dollar recently. This is despite efforts to break a 17 year era of negative interest rates in March 2024.Japan has a current account surplus and is a big net creditor to the world. So the falling Yen isn't about any of that. Instead, it's about Japan's huge debt load, which forces BoJ to keep rates low even as they rise everywhere else. A fiscal crisis playing out in currency space.Source:Yen Record Lows</content>

      <content>I'll invalidate if we break structure. I entered pre-emptively before the swing failure top formed. R:R is there and I don't mind holding shorts since I get paid in funding. I am not heavily sized in this one. Just 3k but if we retrace 50% I make 1.5k.$BTCcould still do a triple top to 75k - I am prepared for that.</content>

      <content>GM, Let's talk Trading PsychologyI have had this public trade log for 3 years already & been in this space for 10 years now.There's 2 approaches to trading;(1) run it up turbo, risk crashing & burning(2) slow, compounded gainsBoth works. I want to believe I am good enough to do the former. Yes, I can grow a 3 digit account to 7 relatively fast with risk, but it's entirely different to turn a 7 digit account to 8 even alone.Whenever I do the former(1)and take high leverage/size/margin, I do make huge profits, but then at the same time, I stop working out, live like a hobo & I burn out for 2-3 months after that - just due to general health/mental toll/quality of life issues. There was also an instance I had dry eyes and was in the hospital just from staring at the screen too much.Over the years, I have been awake at ungodly hours with my trading view alerts and scripts trying to snipe perfect entries. Yet perhaps the superior strategy I realised would be(2)and just to trade on a longer outlook, lower size, more sleep, better health/longevity and less stress.Why don't I trade more counters?I believe anything can be traded, I've tried forex, crypto, nfts, stocks, commodities across almost every kind of derivatives (forward, swaps, cfds, options, futures) - I am simply just used to$BTC,$XAU,$SPY/$ES,$QQQ/$NQas my mainstays. I have to recalculate my lot sizing, r:r, volatility and greeks whenever I touch new counters. Not messing with a system that works.</content>

      <content>Booked shorts, flipped long.Market was heavy for a while. There were signs. Most recently the reaction to HK ETF launch headline, which we not only didn't pump but went down on. And the positive inflows with price down days. TheIranian strikeserved as a catalyst, people were looking for a reason to sell.This is also supported by Dalio's theory and principles on "Why Nations succeed and fail." You can see these with the rise in commodities, defence stocks and precious metals lately, and the steep sell off in risk-on assets in tech, crypto, EVs and equities.Gm. Letting some run!</content>

      <content>How much blood? ü©∏$2B+ Wiped from the open interest. Funding rateswent temporarily negativeclose to the 60k local bottom.That's one hell of a week-end flush. Haven't seen one as bad as this the entire bull market. When funding goes negative and you see mass liquidations at this speed, generally we get a decent relief rally? Why? Funding in Futures is rudimentarily speaking like Rho in Options and Overnight/Swap Fees in CFDs; it's the cost of borrowing. With prevailing US interest rates at 5.5%, negative funding implies you get paid to open longs/you get paid to buy.Rare scenario, but we saw this before in March 2020 as well. I've seen larger crypto flushes ofc but this one is the fastest in recent memory.</content>

      <content>Equities Futures look to be opening green üëÄüòÇ This is why I closed off my$NVDAshorts as well on Friday. I can see relief if no nukes. I do not like holding risk over the weekend on equities these days, there's too much I cannot control. Weekend Wall Street is generally illiquid and manipulative.When playing with derivatives, it's highly important to be perceptive to Options hours, Forex Sessions, Futures carry.Pros of a Futures perpetual market like Bitcoin is I can actively manage positions. Cons is I literally have the worst circadian rhythm known to man.</content>

      <content>Buttcoin rallies off fading TensionsVery strong rally of the lows.

      <content>I did anticipate the dead cat bounce on$TSLAfrom 165 here as well (^above) and I also said we would still go to the 135-145 magnet. That's the real demand zone I am considering! Hence, I took a quick scalp from 165 to 180 back then. This 135-145 zone should produce a bigger bounce. I am scaling in of course and not full-sizing at 145 LOL.

      <content>Market Recap:Short-term outlook (1 Week):Stocks & Crypto to Bounce, Gold & Dollar to weaken.Mid-term outlook (1 Month):Equities continue down to final targets before resume.Long-term outlook (1 Year):Gold & Silver at 3k eventually; Final blow off bull run of risk-assets into 2025 to close off the election year; maybe we get a financial collapse of the monetary system somewhere along the way - will consider Hedges with Vix. This bull-run thesis changes if we break certain levels but if 450$SPYholds and 40-50k$BTCholds I don‚Äôt see why we don‚Äôt continue upwards with our money printers!Chat Update:Also, i‚Äôll do be doing exclusive coaching calls June onwards and scaling off lesser daily updates on this chat. Been already doing it for 3-4 years for free now. I personally do not day-trade anymore, neither do I want to coach it as it will mess with my psych√© and longer term opinions. Partly another reason why I was hesitant about doing courses is that I do not want to change/teach a different style of trading as opposed to mine which is working for me. I believe if I am as good a trader as I believe I can be then I should be able to compound an actually sizeably large portfolio over the next few years and I will not get there selling signals as a get rich quick scheme. My teachings will not be short-term signals based.</content>

      <content>This is a close-up of the wedge I drew in March. I have stated March/April to be Bearish. We reach full drop potentially to 455-465 on$SPYin June based on Time arcs. Elliot Waves ABCDE should look like this. I can see$NVDAat 600s at the end of this easily. The larger wedge see us continuing upwards after that. This is of course predicative and dependent on how the geopolitical tensions plays out!</content>

      <content>R:R actually not great for longs cause we generally do stairs up and elevator down for risk assets - which implies that there also not much "meat" from A to B as your wave 1 is normally your smallest wave as compared to the impulse wave C, also need to validate Elliot Waves with stochastics. Look how the sell the news event happened with the halving and how well-timed this turmoil is... Suspiciously feels orchestrated which is why I mentioned we would have a liquidity event. I am no soothsayer or clairvoyant but it's always so suspiciously well-timed whenever bad news happens üòÇ.</content>

      <content>Have flipped long on US & China equities. Crypto is probably chop. With gold neutral to bearish. Asian session so far looks like a risk-on scenario with gold & dollar dropping. I believe Friday's drop was a confluence of Iran-Israel tensions, and triple witching.No big news day till Thursday's Unemployment Claims - So I believe we see some relief on risk assets barring no big fud.

      <content>Markets are pricing in rate hikes now after months of running up on sentiments of rate cuts. I believe we still get our cuts after a liquidity credit event brings us down to our final buy point with$SPYat 450-470 and$BTCat 45-55k.For now, we relief up with a risk-on scenario with gold falling.Still in my risk asset longs!There are of course many options to make money here. I could have shorted gold or I could have long equities. I did both. Will be selling cash secured puts on$GLDsoon to reassign the gold I sold at the top. This is a neutral bearish strategy as we have dropped a fair amount today.ECB is probably going to cut rates first in June, implying a weakening euro against a strong dollar. Thus, EURUSD bearish in the mid term.</content>

      <content>Told you guys Gold would reject off the kill zone at 2400! This was a good$XAUshort as in terms of percentage movement, it was more than an equivalently sized$SPYlong. More bang for your buck in terms of higher volatility when gold is not conventionally volatile.$XAUshould find support at2260-2292where$SPYwould correspondingly be at 505-507 where I will exit longs. I am going to sell cash secured puts with a 5-10 days expiration for gold based on how much I think it could move during this period (We optimise by calculating delta/gamma for$GLD).</content>

The entirety of the move down and up and then this next move down was planned. I plan for contingencies, I plan for black swans.I don't doubt my choice, I don't second guess myself.

      <content>US relief rally looks to be stalling with price trading near 5100 yesterday, and starting to trade back below 5000 this morning. The best relief rallies convince participants the pullback is over. Staying ‚Äòstuck‚Äô in this5000-5150range for another week would help that cause.Decline targets remain 4800, and the4500-4600range under a stronger corrective move.I am not ruling out a final$SPYmove to 511-515 if you read my twitter. I think this takes 1-2 weeks to trap some longs.Gold can then possibly recontinue the run to 3000s on a risk-off scenario. China might pull back a little if there's a liquidity/major geopolitical crisis so I would watch the inverse HnS trendline.</content>

      <content>Wow üòÆ‚Äçüí® I made 840.52% now! All by doing nothing but shifting the leverage up, at no risk to the FURUs notional running size.Common grift. Ask your FURU for their PnL statements, most are generally larpers.Personally for myself, I only use 1-1.5x leverage (in terms ofMarginused). More leverage means you need to be more precise, and that also lowers your margin of error possibility. Greater leverage while can mean greater profits and losses, can also mess with your trade systems - as you are not only risking more, but also leveraging your emotions.No great trader with proper size uses heavy leverage.</content>

      <content>$SPYmight give us 511-515. However, I have fully exited my longs at 507 as I mentioned. Will slowly be laddering in shorts.However I still believe trend to be down by May/June. 1 Bank Closure is not going to cause the collapse immediately.Unlike other Finance Gurus (not that I consider myself one), I think I have been very consistent and transparent with my trade setups and direction. I have not been flipping back and forth because of inconsequential intraday market movements. I do not daytrade as I said. Training myself to hold positions which can only be done with little to minimal leverage for sanity of mind.</content>

      <content>Yen Drops Massively despite Tightening RatesThe yen‚Äôs plunge to 34-year lows (falling 11 per cent against the US dollar so far this year) has come despite a historic exit from negative rates last month as traders bet Japanese rates will remain low for some time.The Estimated Yen carry trade* in stocks and bonds is ~$4.5 trillion. The carry trade occurs when one *Borrows in a currency with low rates (Yen) and investing proceeds in a higher-yielding currency (USD). Japan is also the second largest holder of US Debt behind China.It is a big risk if it unwinds. The more the Yen falls the higher probability that the Bank of Japan will rise rates or maybe even the US Fed will cut if risks goes global. In that case carry trade becomes less profitable and may trigger capital outflow from US bonds and stocks.Source:Yen all-time Low</content>

      <content>Very rare that we get negative funding in$BTC, should have some tiny relief here - negative funding and huge long liquidations would be my queue to flip long. presently only the former of those criterias are met.Negative funding implies you are being paid to long and borrow money; just means there are too many market participants on the short-side of the market in derivatives. Derivative flows often dictate the markets more than spot as there's just more volume/liquid in those market.</content>

      <content>How-to Stink BidHow I do this is that I ladder across High Volume Nodes and different demand zones. If it goes down to my max extension point, I will likely be up to 1.5-2.5x Cross Leveraged; hence, price would need another 33-50% drop to liquidate me. To prevent this, I either ladder across a wider region or pre-place an SL with my orders. I use pretty rudimentary math and IV to see how far it can go but over the years, this system has worked for me in getting very good entries. Crypto works brilliant for this as there are so many leveraged retail players buying into higher extrinsic value.Fair Warning: You should also research the depth, orderbooks & market markets of your respective exchanges as back in March 2020, some exchanges were actually illiquid and books were so thin everyone was essentially liquidated. I can name many examples just of experience.</content>

      <content>Bearish economic data today as well as risk-off into FOMC. Feels like a nothing burger though so far though!Market is probably starting to price in a potentially hawkish rhetoric by Powell given the last 3 months of persistent inflation data. I think the devaluing Yen & Yuan is also of concern to the US Fed as they are the largest 2 holder of US debt and might dump treasuries to perk their own currencies, while buying more gold for reserves. If we do continue higher for longer, I think more banks will crack as well.</content>

      <content>There's a rudimentary math behind what I do. Why I don't add more shorts, and why I only de-risk positions by closing. Simply put: Why would I take on more risks when the probability of a bounce gets higher, the lower we draw down? This is why I scale in and out of trades; I do not add shorts on the way down, or add longs on the way up (These can work once or twice but it's not proper risk management, it's more akin to momentum VWAP day trading). I do not chase or fomo. These are lessons I learned early on in trading and a principle-based approach with my 7 Golden Rules of Trading (I wrote this myself 7 years ago).At best, I hedge with options or move closer to delta/gamma neutrality. In the long run, I must have positive expectancy to be an effective trader.</content>

      <content>This was before I slept. I think majority of my$SPYforce closes are at 502-504. I sold 0DTE puts at 504 and 502 strike for little premiums < This was quite dumb but I was tired. My entry at 509.61 was pretty good as I only suffered a 2.5k drawdown to make close to 25k so far. Good 1:10 RR. Have some$NVDAshorts too!I dumped majority of my China positions as well as aggressively hedged the remainder of my long-term portfolio. I see potential for a small relief today. Should have traded some$VIXwith a back call spread but I was also a little tired. Perhaps I should put more time into trading.Interesting how people think of$XAU$GLDas a market hedge but it's just been dumping alongside$BTCand$SPYas well. Might enter gold again soon.</content>

      <content>Equities Wrap-upYesterday presented a lot of volatility in terms of earnings. One of the biggest movers was$CVNA. Despite their 40% move up; they still have what I believe to be negative earnings due to warrant markups to FMV on their stocks.I still think the valuations on a lot of US stocks are insane. It is merely propped up. It is extremely dangerous to short and a lot of people tend to short when it's flat & then die. (Ticker showed many margin calls on this yesterday). This is when I START to build a small short position or a bear debit spread on unsustained rallies like this on bad companies. Looks purely like a short squeeze.As it stands, I am still going to be shorting US Tech and long China AI ($BABA$BYD$NIO).</content>

      <content>Full Disclosure:I have taken close to 3-5 million in total trade volume the last 3 weeks & while I did make a good 60k. Upon my calculations, it simply would not even have outperformed just holding my 3000 shares of$BABAwhich I bought at a cost average of $69 (shown) & even giving the price target of $80 with the breakout on the May FOMC. I sold half of these on the way up, thinking I can deploy the margin to better use on other investments and re-enter my Chinese stocks.Sometimes you can predict everything but still poorly execute. Bear in mind, I was extremely on point with my$SPY&$BTClongs and shorts and yet I would still underperform a simple buy & hold strategy with 10x less equivalent risk undertaken in trade volume and opportunity cost.Granted 3000 shares in one stock is extremely high allocation because that would exceed 50% of my entire stock portfolio. That being said; profits are profits and there's always a next trade.Lesson in there.</content>

Totally normal... Without the maverick and innovator in the Late Steve Jobs, it appears Apple is just pandering to the likes of balance sheets & shareholders.Source:How you like them apples?(- Good Will Hunting)</content>

They said to dollar cost average, they didn't say which direction üò´That being said, with the backdoor QE resuming based on FOMC Minutes, I am inclined to believe the US is going to allow inflation (at least at current levels) to devalue their debt.

      <content>The only US stocks I feel are still undervalued are$PYPLand$META.Yes, even after a 500% move from the 80s, it's still not an expensive stock by any measure. Especially after the earnings drop on$METAand the Tiktok ban. I will be accumulating these as well or at least selling puts.If you believe that the US economy will be fine, it's an easy buy at these prices.$CVNAbear spreads at the 145-165 levels are also a play. There's overhead resistance at the 200 SMA line, garbage stock by any measure that suffers from high rates, it's at fibo exhaustion levels, and we just had an ersatz short squeeze move up where insti shorts were forced to cover.</content>

      <content>Sharing a long-term trade setupHow to hedge the US MarketCounters:$TLT$SLV$SLJ$VIX$UVXY, etcLet me prephase this by saying the US equities market is simply still... overbought. I've shorted this a few times but I had to be very precise with my levels. On the contrary, what are good hedge exposure for an equities portfolio aside from dangerously direct shorting.There's a very high R:R trade in$TLTif we ever get into a recession and the fed finally does cut; this can easily double or triple even.. I predict that a larger equities correction happens in June-August and at the bottom when banks fail/war strifes. The US is forced to devalue once again & resume QE. With lowered rates, long term yields then soar. Entry on these is in the $70-80 region.$SLVis also in a cup and handle and normally lags behind gold by 4-5 months (almost there with a bull flag/penant forming); with the gold-silver ratio at ATH of 87:1 now it is the most underpriced in over a century. This is normally manipulated by institution such as JP Morgan but a small holding might be in order. Aside from gold$GLD$XAU, miners in$NUGT$SILJcan be seen to be consolidating.Not$VIX$UVXYfor beginners as leveraged contango kills you. For those more skilled, a timed call backspread works on these.Or just buy more China, Japan equities on pullback$HSI$CWEB$YIFF$A50 $1329 $9988, etc</content>

      <content>$SLV&$TLThave gone up 5% and 2% since I wrote this, I bought in at 24.5 and 88 respectively. This US equities pump still seems extremely suspicious to me given its on the backdrop of record low volumes as well as defence stocks rising and oil still suppressed. There is a very peculiar and unusual correlation with these traditional risk-off assets rising (Gold, Silver, Bonds) alongside risk-on assets (Crypto, Stocks) rising as well!Rather than short heavily I am leaning towards just holding my holdings in$SLV$GLD$XAUbonds. I also think Crypto decouples from US equities and bull runs later on towards the year with rising inflation.</content>

      <content>Market Colours today: Float is extremely bad on$GME, there is no fundamentals but I wouldn't short without stops given this has garnered sizable media attention with Roaring Kitty, Andrew Tate & media outlets now picking up on it. The fomo retail can be hard to predict. Most of the toppish action happened pre-market so you were unable to do puts as usual.$BABAalso correcting hard after earnings. Continuing the trend of buy the rumour, sell the news with$METAand$TSLAfront-running their earning results and fading the news. Nothing too unexpected. Still bullish China as a whole! I also feel the bonds rising and risk-off assets rising along with a steepening yield curve still spells warning for US equities.Am on bear call spreads for$SPYunder strike 530 and starting to sell cash secured puts back on the$BABAI sold.</content>

      <content>Another time where the PPI comes in extremely hot and US stock markets runs up. The last 3-4 times this happened we dump on the following CPI. I expect a rally in pre-markets and into the data release but a fade into the close.Coffee was removed from CPI metricswhich makes me believe Inflation is indeed hot. Cleveland Nowcasting which generally has been a good precursor to the actual data has headline coming in at 3.5%. Inflation is reaccelerating no doubt and I believe we get a 2nd run of Inflation like the 1970s and an eventual hard landing now after the election shennanigans.</content>

      <content>As stated, think we get a rally and fade into the close. This is not very jarring numbers. Not buying US equities here still aside from my tiny gambling positions in$CLOV, but selling credit spreads.I have rebought some$BABAtoday and yesterday as I was forced assigned previously to sell what I sold from my entry 68 at these prices. The 7% dip here is enough for me to bite.$NIO$JD$PDDstill performing for me! Still selling far out covered calls on these.</content>

      <content>^^^ Still the better play. Long bonds, gold, silver and China. Why buy overvalued US equities when the risk-free rate is so high on bonds, and 20Y treasuries can also appreciate in anticipation of easing conditions. Still in my$SLVfrom $24 and$TLTfrom $88. Only thing I have added back is$BABA. China is also starting to print, only difference is that they're actually undervalued unlike the US due to the China ADR Risk Premium basing it off either the DCF/PE models.</content>

      <content>If you're bullish China like me, there's KWEB, CWEB, YINN with 1x, 2x, 3x Leveraged respectfully. I choose the un-levered former because I have spare capital to deploy, I don't want to bother with carry costs and expense ratios, and I like the options tape volume to sell options. If I were trading news speculatively, I'd go for A50 on CFDs.I have some$BYDas well as I think it's really fighting for top dog in the EV space against Tesla.

My portfolio is literally hard carried by China, mainly because it's 70% China and 30% Gold/Silver/Bonds.I am trying to invest on valuations and$BABAis one of the only companies in the market I see with reasonable valuations. I still believe!! Selling covered calls far out and with ridiculous strikes as usual, not trying to get assigned.</content>

      <content>Good bite yesterday to add more$BABA. I principally only buy on dips. All money printers are on and every country is basically outcompeting to devalue against their currency against another for competitive advantage. Once again, comes at the price of citizens losing their purchasing power.A lot of this has to do with the oil trade.Oil declines >>> 10-year Treasury yield followsOil down + 10-year Treasury yield down >>> Markets upKind of why you don't want to be long oil or short bonds. Hence, my thesis for a China Rally and Long US Bonds at least till June FOMC.</content>

      <content>I will once again still warn you about the US market right now. Yes, they are printing but this comes at the price of a heavily devaluing dollar; even when you peg it against the SMCI world or SG 30 Index. This is the same with the Yuan & Yen most recently.I also think the flows in$SMCIand$NVDAhave the current potential to offer a stock split soon! A stock split offers smaller retail investors an opportunity to invest but also provides new exit liquidity. Generally, this is when the market retraces as when$TSLAled the reversal down in 2021 after their split. Not a hater, just being objective - that there are easier trades. Laser-eyes with China, cautiously bullish with US.</content>

      <content>My$XAUgold target is 3-3.5k, but minimally 2.6k. I think this comes along with an equities crash. It's been in this channel too long. Silver$SLVjust has a higher beta and it normally catches up 6 months later.Lumber to gold ratio helps to predict up upcoming market correction as investors are flocking towards safe heaven. If the ratio plunge below zero it might show imminent market correction.$SPYcould run to 540 to 600 based on the channel but this appears to be an election year blow off top as they print to erase debt, I would not direct short with current macro.</content>

      <content>People tell me Silver$SLVis slow and I should buy Bitcoin but it's literally done 40% in the last 3 months when I first talked about it and$BTChas done nothing. That being said, I of course am bullish Bitcoin. I just like to find exponential returns.This was a pretty easy trade since gold ran already and Silver started showing signs of strength. Just know this chart is a 20 year long chart and people who bought Silver in 2011 are still not recovered while banks like UBS short it. Gold$XAUhas ALREADY breached ATHs. Silver$SLVis next! My TP could even be something ridiculous like 59 if we do get a black swan event like 09.</content>

      <content>$SPY$QQQUS Market ran up yesterday on the close. Doesn't affect my bear spreads too much. Still think there's downside to US equities! Looking to re-enter into my China Equities slowly now. I think$TLT's pullback is also good for cash secured puts and a buy soon.In other news, Toobit is now closed - so it was a right move shifting back to Binance and Dexes last month. Will aggressively trade the remainder of this account till June 30th I guess!</content>

      <content>The Indian Stock Market Crashesü©∏The Indian Stock Market crashed today with one of the largest volatility move down in four years plunging 7% after Modi wins. Shares in Adani Enterprise plunge 25pc as prime minister‚Äôs party risks reduced majority.This marks as the WORST stock market dip on the day of the elections in the last 20 years.It's also the steepest decline of NIFTY & Bombay SENSEX since the Covid crash of 2020.Trading was suspended twice when the S&P BSE Sensex fell more than the 10% limit, the first time in the exchange‚Äôs history. This is reminiscent of what happened with the S&P during the 2020 Covid Crash as well. It's important to note that there is likely continuation to this move as did back then. History does not repeat but often rhymes.Why does this matter?I believe in the theory that markets move in boom and bust cycles. Liquidity will have to flow elsewhere as with Balance of Payments, Surpluses and Deficits. I am still betting on China.Source:Indian Markets Crash June 4th</content>

      <content>Indian Markets crashing massively. China Markets chopping.US markets and equities largely not moving due to no data these few days. Unemployment claims on Thursday should likely be moot also. I believe FOMC in June 11-12 should see us holding - Would be interesting if the Dot plot for 2024 policy rate goes to only one 25bp cut (from 3 forecasted previously). I think Banks and Bonds will benefit a lot from a cut eventually (Still buying into$TLTand$BMOCanadian/Montreal Bank on the dips, think Trudeau is messing up his country)Hence, also why I am opting for small shorts on$CVNAwhile holding larger bear call spreads on$QQQand$SPYstill. Been holding all these for a month now! Will start sell cash secured puts on$BABAsoon!</content>

      <content>BREAKING: Bank of Canada cuts interest rates by 25 BPS, the first in the G7 to do so. Might be a precursor of what's to come with the June FOMC. This will likely lead to a 2nd run of Inflation and a Arthur Burns > Paul Volker scenario when it gets out of hand again.$BABAup 2% since yesterday. Bank of Montreal drops upon rate cuts. I think$BMO$SLVand$TLTare still a long if we get more cuts. Basically, long bonds, precious metals and banks.</content>

      <content>June FOMC Pre-fight Weigh-insPrima Facie, the US should cut due to bank pressures with bank rates already reflecting lowered FFRs along with election year posturing.However, with Reverse Repo running out and China selling U.S. Treasuries and Yellen having to pressure Japan (2nd largest holder of debt) to not dump treasuries at the cost of their own dying currency. There is a lot of pressure to keep rates high.Canada's cut is different as they are forced to save an economy which is 90% housing.Core inflation going crazy with a plummeting Loonie at the cost of saving the wealthy land owners. There's a reason Trudeau tested bank account seizers in Canada.Final Take:I believe we hold ratesand there is a chance Every nation in the world will be cutting rates while the US holds them.This will cause currencies to collapse while the Dollar skyrockets, forcing nations to sell US Treasuries significantly below face value. Think the US still eventually cuts soon in the subsequent meetings.</content>

      <content>Call me crazy but I am getting bearish US equities again for a larger drop in the next few weeks.NVDA stock split on low outstanding shares propping up a narrow equities market, US Oil prices dropping 10%, Precious metals rallying, and finally rate cuts beginning the steepening of the deepest inverted yield curve in history. Once again, don't have to short, but I see the danger here.$TLT$SLV$SHstill works. No$VIXfor me.</content>

      <content>Bird flu is spreading and war tensions are getting high. Honestly no point buying bird flu stocks so pre-emptively as even if a pandemic happens, it would literally stiffle production, and spread fear such that money would be pulled out of the system anyway.Same goes for China stocks & Precious Metal, I like them for valuations but I did take some profits and sold calls to hedge from my initial 300k shares in$BABA$KWEB$SLValready. Will look to buy more after the US equities market dips as I believe there's a contagion effect. Patience! ü§ôüèº</content>

      <content>What's happening with Tesla$TSLAcurrently is in one of the tightest bands and wedges. Aside from the broader market being overbought, massive competition from China in the EV space, and rate cuts happening. With the Tesla shareholder's meeting 1 week away to decide on the 56 Billion Dollars Remuneration Package, it‚Äôs decision time for the stock.If shareholders vote no and Musk goes, price tanks. I can even see$TSLAgoing to the $60-80 support if this happens.If Musk stays,The cult props up the share price. But you give him the shares and he might still dump the other portion of his stock anyway and tanks the price.Both cases look bearish to me. I am just being objective here. I am not a perma-bear, I even took the longs from $130 to $200 if you scroll up. With this whole time it‚Äôs been chop, I still made money elsewhere in the meantime and now I am finally re-looking at$TSLA.2 Plays here:(1) Long Vega with a Bull Strangle, to bet on a volatility move. (Safer)(2) Buy OTM Calls or Puts (Yolo)With volatility so cheap here, I might even think a yolo play to buy OTM Puts at $80 is good just as insurance. A 20th¬†Sep $85 Put costs only $0.40Source:Decision Time for Tesla</content>

      <content>TLDR;$BYD>$TSLAI waslong $TSLA from $140 to $200and thenI flipped short from $195 targeting $165-175region which we are at now. I have mentioned I closed during both instancesOnce the chunk of the move is done, you simply get out. Sure I could have held that $195 short, but that's capital I don't have to deploy in other trades in my Silver, China plays. This week is the time to look at$TSLAagain. I am sorry to perma bulls, but the headwinds might be too strong on this one. I think$TSLAhas ran its course and a lot of perceived value is only because of Musk at the helm. If he leaves, I expect the shares to tank - I am looking at under $80 frankly.For context, Koguan Leo is the 3rd largest individual shareholder of Tesla. He lives in Singapore and also voted no to Elon's pay package inciting him to leave.</content>

      <content>NVIDIA splits today$NVDAhas gone through 5 stock splits that preceded a major correction1999: 2-for-1 split > Correction2000: 2-for-1 split > Correction2001: 2-for-1 split > Dot Com2006: 2-for-1 split > Housing Crisis2021: 4-for-1 split > Covid-19 PandemicIs this coincidental rather than causal? A lot has to do with NVIDIA being a high-beta, high growth tech stock. Hence, whenever the market gets too frothy, boards naturally opt to split.$NVDA10/1 split will make the float from 2.5 to 25 billion shares.NVIDIA is severely hard-carrying the indices right now. To put things into perspective‚Ä¶NVIDIA Market Capitalisation: $2.97 trillionBrazil GDP: $2.2 trillionThe US and NVIDIA currently still has the ability to ‚Äútransform‚Äù ersatz asset bubble wealth into real wealth, because it can ‚Äústeal‚Äù other nations‚Äô productive capacity via dollar hegemony. Is this a bubble? Idts, but it‚Äôs overpriced due to limited supply and slow competitors to disrupt the monopoly.</content>

      <content>Elections & Rate Cuts happening Globally but the devil is in the details!We have just seen Mexico's Election, followed by India, and now Eu and next UK on July 4th followed by the US.If you're noticing a trend that rates are cut right as election comes, you're right!The risk premiums of France, Italy, Austria, and Spain over Germany are widening significantly because the EU is not only coming under pressure from the outside following the growth of right-wing populists, but internal cracks are also becoming apparent.Bond Prices across Europe are rising today. In a matter of who cuts first - by the US Feds delaying cuts till their elections, it holds their bonds suppressed (see TLT) and allows the dollar to strengthen further. If the dollar rips, guess what happens to risk-assets like Bitcoin and US Tech for now?</content>

      <content>Sharing some of my thought processwith a friend as to why I shorted 71.2k and called for this TP at 66k and the bounce. There was a lot of ersatz support along the way but I chose the one where most leveraged longs die (a 5-10% drop on$BTCand 20-40% on alts liquidates most leveraged positions of 10-20x; the default). Supports are chosen on a combination of demand zones, liquidity, dark pools and max pain options.I can't say for sure where is the true bottom as I cannot be predicative or am privy as to how inefficiently markets are priced and what CPI/FOMC brings this week. I have always just made my best guess.Why do we need to tap lows before the run-up?While the financial markets are not a zero-sum game and are priced upwards due to stimulus and irresponsible J Pow prints, they cannot allow high leveraged longs to run-up on derivatives, and they have to lower longs by either funding/decay or a liquidation hunt.In the long-run, due to the nature of Bitcoin, we are destined for 100k+.</content>

Fed Chair Powell says the Fed does not have high confidence in their forecasts.More importantly, officials are mixed on the dot plot with 2, 1 & no rate cuts for this year all still on the table.Should be range and chop for awhile before we climb the wall of worry.

      <content>Open Interest, OI for$BTCstill going up at these levels, implying accumulation if we are ranging. I am likely buying back 61.4k-59k to load up more for the final rally up. As long as the 55k macro level doesn't break, still bullish in the mid-term (I don't see it going there right now with nothing bad happening in the world). Still buying!</content>

      <content>Same chart on$BTCas above, there's probably a smaller elliot wave within the Wave 5 down. I've talked about this final Wave 5 down before. When the stochastic oscillators validate the swing failure top then we can potentially push for the final move to 55k. Bullish as long as we hold that HTF support.I presume$SPYUS Equities should do a blow-off top then as well. Coincides with fractals and risk assets bottoms likely with CPI/PPI news on July 11/12th. Heavily dependent on the Inflation Data having to show slowing.</content>

      <content>Interesting how the Dollar$DXYis weakening. I sus-ed out the move to close my longs during that Powell speech (above^) where he leaned dovish and posited starting the easing cycle later this year; leading to a strong reversal down of the dollar strength. Crypto has since depegged from tradfi equities market with the stock market$SPY$QQQstill rallying while Crypto$BTCfalls with Dollar Strength and Hegemony.Is this the time where we consider Crypto's potential status as a reserve currency instead of a risk asset?</content>

      <content>TLDR; Crypto is more correlated to the dollar now as opposed to risk tech assets. Additionally, it's a simple case of more supply than demand causing downward price action with Mt Gox, ETFs, Halving, Germany Central Banks selling Crypto inducing selling pressure on Crypto.$BTCbottoms when$SPY$QQQtops in that case.</content>

Seems like just a relief rally on a VIX crush Friday with dip buyers on low volume and no economic data. I don't think the Banks have finished selling.Will close levered positions at B and reassess data over the weekend. A little tired.</content>

      <content>US Markets FrothI'll do a further analysis on the US equities market but we're very frothy right now esp on Big Tech. Just been green day after green day. I'm too cautious to buy longs/calls here as I can't control what happens during the non-US zones and I feel 0DTE can cause it to fall any moment so I don't want to be caught offside. Only way I would play this is on futures/CFDs where I can put a SL perpetually at the cost of incurring swap fees. Alternatively I could buy OTM puts for insurance on current positions.$VIXisn't even a hedge anymore due to vol suppression. Not shorting atm but waiting for supply levels.This might be hard to understand for some as normally I try to dumb it down to make it easier to understand as my thinking is normally wired a bit differently lol.</content>

      <content>Re-calibrated C to 54.4k$BTC. Low volume node here so I don't expect 56k to hold. If you're shorting I would hold till C.Not sure on D because Powell could say anything on Tuesday tbh. Downtrend still intact and if equities flip, crypto will be pulled down with it. Especially since with the introduction of$BTCETFs, deleveraging/liquidation cascades can still occur on the insti side. If it's not clear already, I have taken profits at 57.8-58.1k like I repeatedly said and I have stops at my entries from the lows. I am almost always in the green due to how precise my entries are.</content>

      <content>That being said, I think after the D move on$BTCwe go down to green zone 48.5k (will analyse this later).

      <content>Yes, the$QQQand$SPYcan continue to go up. Basically everything is a melt-up if we're loosening policies. Markets are priced upwards. However, it's more likely better and safer profits in a broader based index$DJI$IWM, even$TLT.Why$TLT?Again, when the supply of short-term debt instrument through issuance slows. Rate cuts would make short-term interest rates lower than long-term ones. Generally, bonds with long maturities and low coupons have the longest durations. These bonds are more sensitive to a change in market interest rates and thus are more volatile in a changing rate environment.TLDR, cut in Fed Funds Rate, TLT Booms üöÄ</content>

How often do we see unemployment data revised? or Markets ignore PPI, CPI, PMI. How do we value a company when PE forward PE is 40-70 right now on US tech. Data days are only important to fade moves and monitor volatility.</content>

      <content>Nikkei NI225 gaps down 2% on the open. Very likely due to the carry trade unwinding. US Printed a cool CPI report inducing higher likelihoods of rate cuts in the dot plot and lower yield on the carry trade. Since dollar weakens, and yen strengthens. This directly weakens Japanese equities market. Further noting that it has also been overbought for a few days now just like the US. Many factors to play.But also why I was watching the Yen last night with my previous write-up!</content>

If bad entries then bopez.I am also managing my broader portfolio with Japanese, Chinese and US funds so I try to just shift between sectors/geographical regions.</content>

      <content>Bitcoin Rises Amid Trump Shooting IncidentNew York, 14th July 2024 ‚Äî Bitcoin surged to 60k USD today after former President Donald Trump was shot at a campaign rally. With Trump in stable condition, the incident is seen as potentially increasing his re-election odds, prompting investors to seek the safety of cryptocurrency amid market uncertainty.Source:Shooting at Trump's Rally</content>

      <content>Don't think you can predict this... Still holding my 1 BTC spot though as I said. To me low enough is enough. If you go on a positional trade play, and the worst I can see$BTCgoing is 44-48k and my TP is 100k+, that's still enough of a odds ratio given my win rate to get positive expectancy in the long-term. Will be clear bullish once we break the 60-62k levels.</content>

      <content>I am probably looking for 68.1k-68.3k$BTCto consider selling some spot or as a supply zone to rebuy back as I expect a retracement after that.We're going to go to 100k+ after that though...

      <content>Reason I didn't sell my spot I bought at the lows and am not selling now yet either.Trump doesn‚Äôt tilt his head at the last second and we would have gotten 50k$BTC/ 2.5k$ETH.Nobody can predict this market fully. By at least selling the$BTChighs at 72k and targeting 53.8k I likely already saved myself from a lot of pain, unrealised losses and possible capitulation/paper handedness. A lot easier to hold the 53-54k buys when you shorted from 72k, are sitting in profits to buffer, and unscathed from the drop.Eventually we go to 105-110k$BTCone day. I will sell fully there.</content>

      <content>Relief rally here as I said. Green Zone holding for now on$QQQ. I am cautious of another further drop.The Yen JPY gap up due to intervention means a huge unwinding of the carry trade as evidenced also by the big cap techs gapping down huge. This could be a deeper correction on equities where preserving gains and capital is number one. I'd TP this US equities long early and leave a small trailing position with SL at entry likely.</content>

      <content>Feels very normal for$BTCto reject at 70k since it's a whole number, masses starting to buy now when you could at 53k (which I did). Just bear in mind there's zero economic data today so it's a low volume move and pretty useless to watch.</content>

      <content>Closing my last 50% for$BTCshort at 64.4-64.9k. Will opt to flip long there but this is just once again for a tiny scalp relief rally up. Then potentially resume downside to 61-62k if further dragged down by US equities fear/FOMC should be a non-event and already priced in with rates as per dot plot.</content>

      <content>I was trading 15-20$BTCsize like 2 years ago^ (albeit with mark price at 40k-60k, that's about 800k - 1.2 mil margin) and trading 1.5-2$BTCsize now. On an IV and ATR standpoint we used to move 3-10% per days sometimes back then, I think movements are smaller now with more institutional adoption.Just restarting from a smaller account with less leverage for better mental health. I am barely watching this trade tbh, perhaps better this way. I have also hedged my main holdings on the cold wallet with covered calls like I said.</content>

      <content>Waiting for this on$QQQas well. Went short at 497 with 1.5 million at first but pussied out and closed 90% already. Honestly this was my worst close. Think I miscalculated my size and missed out on a ton of profits. Holding the remainder down :( I did have bear call spreads about 1 month ago as well on$SPYif you guys recalled. I believe this drops down further with September seasonality lows & FOMC as the impetus.I still expect China, Commodities, Long bonds to run-up into the late stage of the year after that.</content>

      <content>Kind of what I mean by I can't be extremely predicative as I am not clairvoyant, I just like to think I do better than average at drawing charts. It's easier to be reactive than predictive in certain market conditions esp with economic data as I mentioned before on brownian motion/random walk/game theory. Market can remain irrational longer than you stay solvent blahblahblah.Also, I was trading heavily inebriated and tired I mentioned (those who saw me earlier can attest). So if you copied these trades, you are irresponsible.</content>

      <content>Already at the flip short range... Only took 4 hours to get to 65k. Let me relook the flows.I do a smaller standard 1-2$BTCsize now. Maybe i'll try make it back on the leaderboards but I haven't traded crypto full-time in about 2 years man. I just held spot through the bullrun.With 2-3x Leverage it requires me 6 moves of 10% or more to make 60% returns. Based on daily adjusted IV & ATR this means the average daily move is about 2k or 3%.Not ruling out$BTCto 44-48k completely like I said if equities and the BoJs rate hikes, etc force a liquidity run-off.</content>

Once again, not perfect because I am not a robot and I need to sleep unfortunately.So far shorted 70k to 53khttps://t.me/realisedgainsanalysis/1735Flipped long 53k to 70khttps://t.me/realisedgainsanalysis/1815Shorted 70k to 62.5khttps://t.me/realisedgainsanalysis/1852Flipped long 62.5 to 65khttps://t.me/realisedgainsanalysis/1911Flipped shorted 65k to new lows...Might take awhile this one! Once again, all are just ideas and I put my money where my mouth is so my money can feed my mouth. Don't kpkb if I am wrong.</content>

Will reassess there ü´° ^^^ probably looks like the chart above but D likely lower.Possibly to 58-59k then to 61-62k then chop a few days then 44-48k for$BTC.Please search in chat$BTC/$QQQ/$TLT$SLV$XAG$GLD$XAUif you want to see specific charts.

      <content>Discretionary traders typically rely on trading techniques and strategies that generally have room for interpretation such as chart pattern analysis, support and resistance, Elliott wave, Fibonacci analysis, cyclical analysis and more.Systematic traders require more empirical or mathematical based data which can be programmed into an algorithm. As such, system traders will generally utilize technical indicators such as Stochastics, Williams %R, Average True Range, and more. Additionally they may use price smoothing indicators such as moving averages and price bands such as Keltner channels, or Bollinger Bands.I've always been more discretionary than systematic. There is no room for hesitation in the market. Generally this is why, I choose to avoid alcohol, run/workout to train my tolerance for pain. The best trades tend to be the most painful ones. You call it "brave", I call it contrarian. Drawdowns are purely a didactic exercise to test your measure as a man.</content>

      <content>Just sold some 56k cash secured puts at 59k$BTC, with 3 day strike (24/08/06) to move it less delta negative. Essentially means if it breaks 56k in 3 days I need to TP half my position. Pretty bad premiums with only $200-300 collected but I am trying options on Crypto. Still holding original position size.We're at the 58.4-58.8k support I want already. Just broke under 60k earlier!</content>

      <content>I would argue that the difference this time round is we have the longest steepening yield curve uninversion in history after an unabated period of quantitative easing coupled with the fact with the unwinding of the USDJPY Carry Trade after decades of building up, along with war tensions every other day.Unprecedented times. Either way I am bearish for 1-2 months into this seasonality weakness. Still very bummed I TP-ed so much of my equities one early. Had close to 1.5 million USD in shorts and left with 100k USD now. I need more stoicism in the future. Holding all my shorts.</content>

      <content>Fear is the mind killer. Nobody talks about the psychological aspect of trading enough. It's just digits on a screen but why do we feel so different with 5 digits vs 7 digits on the line. It's probability, permutations and expectancy.‚ÄúI‚Äôve done a lot of thinking about fear. For me the crucial question is not how to climb without fear-that‚Äôs impossible- but how to deal with it when it creeps into your nerve endings.‚Äù - Honnold.</content>

      <content>This might be the most painful period for most investors why? You both lose in USD valuation (weakening DXY) and lower net asset value, NAV (crashing equities and risk assets). No emergency rate cuts till much deeper. Only thing that will be going up is gold, silver and long-dated bonds. I have mentioned this many times. Was slightly early, but not wrong. I've been mentioning July/August for a drop for awhile if you scroll up.- Hamas top leader Ismail Haniyeh killed on Iranian soil.- Hezbollah leader Shukr killed in Israeli airstrikes in Beirut.- BOJ emergency rate hikes.Unprecedented times of strife.</content>

      <content>The most I opened was a 110 BTC short 2 years ago at 60k, so that was like 6.6 million USD size with 400k margin, but I was a different person back then. No risk management and basically irresponsibly sliding the margin up. I could defo get away with it given how precise my entries and exits have been and I don't think my heart could take that anymore. Chance of ruin is much higher the greater your leverage is.He's basically using 210k capital to open 32 BTC (2 million USD) in notional size, that's 8.83x leverage. Given$BTCregularly daily moves 2-5% based on IV/ATR. He doesn't actually have much to work with. Still wondering if he's actually bad, hedging on another account or using a fake ByBit referral account. He's actually going to be liquidated for the full 210k capital at 56098. Liquidation cascade down moving really fast now.</content>

      <content>I also temporarily removed discussion and most reactions because I don't want to engage with anybody tbh. I am just here to share my trade ideas, not here to debate, argue or pander my opinions in an echo chamber.I truly love this volatility though, I managed to eat a lot of the moves from the first 70k down to 53k and back up to 70k and all the way down to here; including all the small moves in between. Volatility is so lucrative for a trader. Managed to let the winners run as well. Very good R:R.</content>

      <content>my next prediction; some crypto exchange is gonna collapse, some bank is gonna fail, US goes about the whole routine stimulating once again, and raising the debt ceiling. then we only go long one week after that.bears have suffered for like months, you think 2 weeks of drop is enough? generally for 4-6 months of up, you see at least a month of down - i'm thinking September!at most i close some of my shorts early, won't be longing that soon. once again, stay humble or the market will humble you. no reaction, just eating my chyepng and going to the gym quietly.</content>

      <content>Storytime; and hopefully a lesson to some new traders out there.Back in2018-2020when I was trading in college and university, I shorted$BTC($XBTon Bitmex) from 11k to 7k. Then inMarch 2020 during the covid crash it dropped from 8k to 3.6k in 1 day. I bought$BTCat 5k thinking it was cheap and got liquidated at 3.6k. This was the same day oil went negative. I remembered the entire order books being empty, they had to shut down exchange sites perhaps because Market Makers needed time to create orders. And then years later, I shorted Crypto fromJan 2022 at 68k to 18k (Check the chat)on FTX and I did managed to withdraw most of it but have still money stuck inside.That being said, today on5th August i'm still going to TP some at 44-48k$BTCout of principle: ) It's not always about maximising profits, and minimising losses, it's about staying in the game.</content>

      <content>Could you survive a bear market anon?I preface a biblical crash because you have to zoom out and see how absurd and ersatz this entire run-up has been, on the backbone of not just tightening condition but fake backdoor easing through the Treasury General Account (TGA), Reverse Repo and Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). I never flipped short or shouted overbought till only 1-2 months back, I have always leaned on July - September seasonality weakness in line with the rate cuts being bearish for a pivot to bail out - slightly early but in the grand scheme of things, these are the decisions that save you.Taiwan stock market TSE worst selloff since 1967, Nikkei worst since 1987 Black Monday, US Tech about to do the same,$QQQopens at 432.While look at China! Down a lot less, and Xi Jin Ping does have the conditions to stimulate if they want to or flip the USDCNY hegemony.I get that you think oh, it's cheap, let's buy the dip, let's catch this falling knife. Hence, why I shared that storytime post above. Study history, learn from my past mistakes. This time is different, only that it is faster - due to 0DTE. We are not at capitulation yet.</content>

      <content>We're in the End Game nowAn orwellian dystopian modern day reality; I've always believed this to be so.With every hegemony ending, it comes with a boom and bust economic cycle culminating inwar and riots.We're seeing a burgeoning feminism movement, a war against men, woke culture and racial and financial divide.Australia raises terror threat level to 'probable', Trudeau accepting immigrants left right and centre, UK protests, US president nominee assassination attempt, Bangladesh riots, Singapore Otter attacksIf you look through the Benner Cycle, and then the 100 year cycles and revolutions. We notice the french revolution in 1700s, Britain in 1800s, US in 1900s, and the 2000s will be China, with the BRICs likely taking over; Lenders refusing to lend beyond a calendar year during the napoleonic years.

      <content>USDSGD currently 1.32. Result of the carry trade unwinding. We're in heavy bear market territory now for equities. Could see$QQQto 405 as well.$TLTas I said also booming up since I called it at sub 90.$BTCis iffy because if you see it as similar to gold i'm bullish. Yet if you see it as risk-on like$NVDAthen I am bearish. That's why I am on more inbetween on it and just betting it's heavy chop. With temporal headwinds pushing it to 40-50k again.</content>

      <content>$QQQto 369-397,$BTCto 44-48k,$SPYto 468-472.Minimally these levels to even consider longs.^ Wrote this awhile back. Easier to buy the dip when you just closed a short and have profits to buffer, at least psychologically. We still have not seen funds, exchanges and banks blow up. Those are the days you buy. This is just a standard liquidation cascade.As to why, Gold Silver or China is also dropping? Generally you have to realise that when big funds unwind their position, they have to sell everything or risk getting margin called. In doing so, gold will see a temporary pullback.When stocks bottom,$TLTpeaks, gold$XAUgenerally lags and silver lags even further$XAG, these are generally not as liquid, but will drop as well, and will resurge after.Refer to chart and explanation here:https://t.me/realisedgainsanalysis/1840</content>

I don't think bull run comes until September seasonality is over.If you recall I shorted$BTCfrom the top at 70k and also sold covered calls for a 2 month expiration there.$VIXbeing high yesterday means IV was high, but today that same$VIXhas retraced back from 70 to 25 approx, killing premiums from both calls and puts. Hence, why selling options is still undefeated. As of now, I am still expecting a further drop later on into September.

      <content>I like$SLV$XAGat 25.7-25.3 if we get there. Would be a great entry imo. Positional trade play. Or just sell cash secured puts since it's only $23-24 on$SLVsilver trust, it would only requite 2.5k margin to pull this off. I would go out a few months expiration because I think that a drop would cause an IV spike which you should capitalise to collect premiums.Another alternative is a long call ladder or a call back ratio strategy.</content>

      <content>Market normally taps liquidity top before a drop and vice versa. You had another opportunity to enter shorts at 61.8k yesterday. With TP at 58.3/57.3k (that's a $4.5k down move). Place SL slightly below latest high (62.4k would be $800 away).At least a 1:4 risk:reward trade. I have a more developed model using Kelly's Criterion to calculate expectancy but you get the gist. I am not a math wizz, I am just a degenerate that got B for stats in University.</content>

      <content>U.S. Stocks and Bond Yields are now in sync, and correlating.Which means that going forward, further weakness in the economy or inflation will implode stocks. In the past, good news was good news and bad news was good news. This is not the case now.With the yield curve un-inversion steepening, this means that short-term rates are expected to fall and this only happens when something in the economy is threatening to break. I said it before, rate cuts are not bullish; they are anemergency measure.</content>

      <content>Hindsight bias, but I should have bought more direct shares as opposed to cash secured puts for$QQQat 432-438-442 like I identified as support for$QQQabove. Cash secured puts means it's not very delta positive and I only collected premiums largely from this run-up. Spread trading can be quite profitable if volatility is spiking again though.$BABAclosing flat after earnings is also suspicious.Generally the last few economic data have always seen the moves play out like this: Cleveland Inflation (pre-cursor) > CPI (fade) > PPI (real move) > Retails Sales/Earning (extended move).</content>

      <content>When to use Log Scaling in Charting?There are two main reasons to use logarithmic scales in charts and graphs (Option + L on TradingView). The first is to respond to¬†skewness/kurtosis towards large values; i.e., cases in which one or a few points are much larger than the bulk of the data. The second is to show percent change or multiplicative factors.How to use ATR to place stop losses.For a weekly trade. Given current$BTCWeekly ATR is 7000, using an SL at 1.5x ATR that‚Äôs 10500. Given downwards move have a higher volatility skew, and we can escape drops to be faster on average than rises. For instance, if targeting TP 44-46k, we should place SL for shorts at approx 69k (= 57300+10500) given mark price of 57.3k. Not great R:R, we‚Äôre at 1:1 now.Still working on my Excel Trade Journal, will release in a few weeks.</content>

Volatility was the cost of trading during these periods. However, not at such obscene valuations.So much for the FED's second mandate of price stability.</content>

      <content>I still think Crypto$BTCcontinues to go up till Thursday/Friday, this goes for equities as well, with the dollar dropping, USDSGD now at 1.30xx. No news is good news. I would take profit for$BTCat red region 63.8-65.9k if on leverage.While I am cautious of weaker seasonality in September. This year might potentially  play out like 2007 when the FED lowered rates after their hiking cycle on ... 9/18! S&P rallied from mid-Aug to the top on Oct 11, 2007. Market rallied 3% from the first 50 bp cut on 9/18/07 then topped on 10/11/07. It then rallied 1% from the 25 bp cut on 10/31/07. After that it was game over.One last hurrah.I am still going to be betting that bonds will outperform stocks in the next few years, hence why I am still in$TLTand China.</content>

      <content>I drew this almost a year ago ^^^ thinking$SPYwould push to 525 from the lows of 380 where I first longed. I took all my profits at 525 and have not bought back US since then. Never thought I would be thinking 590-600 now. Yet I think we're getting there now.TLDR; rate cuts to me are bearish because they are meant to fix and throw a lifeline to a dying market. The first cuts however normally come with emerging problems and the market can still run upwards off the backs of temporary stimulus and buy the dippers before it does a harder correction.So give or take if history rhymes again and this is a 07 scenario with consumer debt unwinding, a further 3% rise can bring$SPXto5900-6050/$SPYto 590-605 area +- 1-2 percent where we top for the year. All speculation ofc.</content>

      <content>I am not leveraged on any of these positions.$QQQand$SPYhave unwinded all the dovish talk gains in the last 30 minutes. On a larger time frame we are still overbought so the max I can see$BTCgoing is 63-65k. However, I will be bearish if we do not break those levels by September. A more straightforward play I am also doing would still be long gold or bonds though. The issue with cutting rates in the September 17/18 FOMC Meeting is that it can possibly reignite inflation and undo the work over the last 2 years.Powell is a master artisan. Wealth inequality has broken new records since 2008. Housing affordability is at an all time LOW & he essentially says the fix is more QE. There will come a point that the bottom 50% is going to get really loud.However, it is still an election year andnumbers are still being doctoredas I mentioned with the Jobs data a few days back.</content>

      <content>Why Rate Cuts can be bearish?First Rate Cut - Jan 3, 2001 (Dot Com Bubble)- S&P 500 fell ~39% next 448 days- Unemployment rose another 2.1%First Rate Cut - Sep 18, 2007 (Sub-prime Mortgage Crisis)- S&P 500 fell ~54% next 372 days- Unemployment rose another 5.3%First Rate Cut - Sep 18, 2024 (AI Hype)- ?- ?Extending the sample size we have 1995, 1998, and 2019, check this out. In all 3 of those examples, unemployment was trending down. 2019 was at a 50-year low. Every other time when unemployment was trending up (as is now) and we saw rate cuts, it led to a sell off in equities and a continued climb in unemployment rate. I talked about this on the Youtube Video as well!</content>

      <content>$CVNAis over 5 billion in debt trading at $156 now with a 32 Billion Market Cap.If we get rate cuts (and we should). I think this tops here. VERY VERY speculative play to short an individual counter but there's good R:R here. However, I think a safer play is still long$TLT$IQD$IEI.Also think Gold will behave like in the last cycles, pulling back initially on rate cuts. Long-dated bonds will react directly up first while gold/bitcoin should give a pull-back before rising.</content>

      <content>Would The Crash Be Bigger Than 2008?Markets are irrational. Feeling like the US markets are constantly being propped up by the Fed because the economy is so much more dependent on asset prices than it was back then. If the stock market went down by 50% in let's say Singapore noone would even know. If the S&P went down 50% it would be complete meltdown of the economy. Keeping the "numbers up" seem more important even it means a lower standard of living for the average Joe. I think we will see a repeat of an increase in wealth gap which will benefit people with assets and put the poor at an even bigger disadvantage.

Triggered a 3 day -9% correction on SPY. This is within cyclical correction and normal seasonality. Notice how$CVNA$BTCboth topped at the same time, it's time for some risk-off action again.

      <content>üßµ Job growth is currently decelerating at a rapid clip just as it did starting in the 3Q of 2007 üö®.The Sahm Rule has recently been triggered! Claudia Sahm created it as a way to time the onset of recessions. The rule states that when the 3-month moving average of the unemployment rate is 0.5% higher than the lowest 3-month moving average of the preceding 12 months, a recession is likely (but not guaranteed). I for one, would gladly welcome a good üß∏ bear market. No real need for much leverage, one good short into a nice long is all you need to set you up for life!</content>

Welcome to the September effect! This time we have an election year, the FED pivot along with it and one of the most insane QE runs since COVID.Why'd I choose to short$CVNAinstead of$NVDA? Well... for one, who shorts$NVDA? lol.

      <content>INTEL faces delisting from Dow as Stock sinks furtherMarkets took a big hit today (4/9/24) on August ISM data, with tech and risk assets falling further. Including the after hours decline,$NVDA's drop marks the largest single day loss of market cap for a stock in history.Speculation is growing also that Intel (INTC) will be delisted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average as the microchip company‚Äôs stock continues to decline. Intel was one of the first technology companies to join the Dow index back in 1999 at the height of the dot-com stock market rally. It has been a member of the Dow for 25 consecutive years.However, the Reuters news agency is reporting that Intel‚Äôs status in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now under threat after the company‚Äôs share price has declined 54% this year.Intel is not only the worst performer in the Dow, an index of 30 blue-chip stocks that‚Äôs meant to represent a cross-section of the U.S. economy, it is also the second-worst performing stock in the benchmark S&P 500 index this year.Reminds me of the time ExxonMobil$XOMwas delisted from the DOW in 2021 to mark the final point of capitulation before it resurged. As a contrarian, de-listment to me is bullish üòÇSource:$INTC -4.80%</content>

These costs could be a small pinch to their financial performances and profit margins, and hence stock price performance. This is amidst fierce battles from competitors including Baidu and Huawei too. One way to mitigate this is to transfer some of these costs over to consumers via higher product prices.

      <content>Update on Positions:If we do get a push re-break ATHs coming into the elections, I think$SPYcould go to 590-605^ for next resistance as what i saidhere, but I am fairly certain either way that most of my other entries on individual countersherewill hold. To me the lows of$NIOat 3.83 where Ibought inwill not be touched and I have said I am looking for a double up on this. I have also said$CVNAat 156would go to zeroeventually but I am obviously not holding this short to zero, I will likely be out of majority of the positions at around 81-92. This would be close to a 50% drop and good enough for me. I did finally close some of my$BTCshort positions from 64.9k at 54.3k-55.2k as per my screenshotsherebut looking for re-shorts.Will still hold the$TLTand$XAU$GLDlongs as I believe US rate cuts will push this up and further unwind the currency carry trade; with BoJ hiking and the jobs report pushing further rate cut pressures on the US Feds dot plot.</content>

      <content>2024 Presidential Debate LIVE now:Generic ballot update: By the time Biden dropped out, Republicans had gained a narrow lead. Today, Democrats are up by about 2¬Ω points. Via ABC News 538:Major Issues discussed today so far were on the Green Deal, High Inflation, High Crime Rates, Fentanyl Surge, Gun Laws, and Illegal Immigrants.Did the biden-harris inflation act so far really reduce inflation? A reduction in the rate of increase in inflation is not a net reduction; going up 20 and down 9 is not an 11% decrease.Trump responds that: "She doesn't have a plan. She copied Biden's plan and it's like 4 sentences: run spot run" - A book on the Ethics of Keeping Pets. It's basically Kamala's Run Spot Run VS Trump's Drill Baby Drill - Oil actually went negative during Trump's presidency LOL.Unfortunately, I believe both the Harris and Trump plans will only continue federal deficits and make the current inflation problem worse. My 2 cents is that it's frankly too late to turn around.</content>

      <content>In other news,$USDJPYcontinues to unwind like I said. This continues BoJ Ueda's move to strengthen the Yen while the US moves towards the FED Pivot of lowering Interest Rates.$USDJPYjust broke 142 for the first time in 2024. The next support is around 125-122, a 25% drop from the June high. This will result in significant pressure to unwind the yen carry trade. I see long treasuries$TLTripping further up as the dollar hegemony falls. We just broke past 100 yesterday.Also have to watch oil as I just said, making a similar move down on$WTI. They're finally talking about Oil and Fracking during the Presidential News debate.</content>

      <content>Traders have nearly ruled out the possibility of a half-point rate cut, and the Fed remains focused on labor market softness, which could influence policy decisions in the coming months. Treasury yields rose, stocks fell, and the dollar pared losses following the data release, reflecting reduced market expectations of aggressive Fed action.</content>

      <content>Trump's 2nd Assassination & Debate Rigging Rumours:I think consensus would agree that Kamala narrowly won the Presidential Debate, yet rumours are now surfacing that the questions were pre-rigged for Kamala and that camera angles were positioned to place Kamala in a better light, amongst others. This comes along with the recent Assassination Attempt by Pro-Ukraine Activist, Ryan Routh at the Florida golf course. This comes along with very big volatility red folder days with the FOMC on Wednesday and Triple Witching (Options Kill Zone) into the Weekend. Historically, the last 2 weeks of September tend to be bearish. Position accordingly.Source:Presidential Race in US - a Banana Republic</content>

      <content>Think$TLTmoves first then$XAUand finally$BTCas perthis trend. As above I am holding my$TLTto 120+as we cut interest rates to the 400 basis points 'neutral' rate. My thesis is that$BTCwill face headwinds and a temporary pullback first along with equities into the FOMC Rate Cuts 18th September, with CZ leaving jail 19th September and Triple Witching for Options on 20th September, along with the Yen-Greenback Carry Trade further unwinding.I did say to run$XAUfrom 2479hereto 2620+, I have alsotargeted 60.5k for the$BTChighs to re-short in my private channelabove^ (image). I will remain cautious till September is over. Too much red folder days and volatility markers are flaring. Same positions still but I am doing some minor hedging to delta/gamma neutrality with options.</content>

      <content>How I am trading the FOMCI am choosing to go slightly negative delta and still bearish into the FOMC because conventionally I have said rate cuts are bearish. There's paltry breadth & volume with an implied move of 1.2% in either direction... highest since the March 2023 regional bank crisis.(Image 1 shown).3 reasons.(1) The markets in the past cycles have TOPPEDinto rate cuts(2) This normally comes with big names doing stock splits (remember $TSLA 2022, $AAPL 2020, etc)(3) Yield Curve Un-inversion Steepening, USD JPY Carry Trade Unwinding, Weakest 2 weeks of SeasonalityCould it be that easy?I have no clue for certain what they will do (50 Basis Points looks to be the majority consensus on CME Fed Watch at 63%)(Image 2 shown).I have switched myshort positions on $QQQto a safer 2-3 months DTE bear spread here.

      <content>Tomorrow is another big volatility day:Triple-Witching event is tomorrow, Friday. Search it up if you don‚Äôt know what it is. It happens quarterly and whipsaws the market. This time though, it will be $5 Trillion worth of US options that will expire and disappear as traders roll their positions or enter new ones.Generally for FED FOMC Decisions, this is the play bookDay 1 is the overreaction.(Yesterday)Day 2 is the reaction to Day 1(Today)Day 3 we find out what the market really thinks about the Fed decision.What I am expecting tomorrow?$SPY564 to 566 would not surprise me on the Open tomorrow. It may pump after that, or it may trade flat until 9/23 then pump going into 10/4 JOBS REPORT. Although there's really not much upside. Additional, we have the SPX Re-balancing After-hours on 9/20. Easier to not trade these last 2 weeks of September and stay flat/low leveraged/defensive like I said.</content>

      <content>FOMC Post-Mortem AnalysisMarkets are set to open today lower, with$SPYlooking to open near 566 like I mentioned yesterday ^ to retrace the large gap up (currently at 567 mark price from yesterday's 570.91 close).Just earlier today, we had theBank of Japan Interest Rate Decisionat 12pm GMT +8, 20th September 2024, following directly after the US - Ueda decided to hold its policy rate steady instead of hiking rates, allowing inflation in Japan to continue to tick up. I believe this allows the carry trade to continue with Japan offering a lifeline to the US. I think this decision will allow the cogs to keep going for a couple more weeks but I still see a decent-sized correction before the EOY Santa Claus Rally.I write aboutmy thoughts in-depth in my first newsletter herealong with my concerns from the FOMC 50 Basis Points Cut, Yield Curve, Carry Trade, and Recession Risk.Newsletter:FOMC 50 Basis Points Cut, Yield Curve, Carry Trade, and Recession Risk.</content>

      <content>Asians got the gold bug üíõChina‚Äôs US Treasury holdings have declined by 30% & still buying Gold on record levels. I can only believe this is a long-term move to attempt to disrupt the US reserve currency hegemony by backing the future BRICs currency with collateral.I will be TP-ing my$XAUGold from2471and looking for re-longs into further highs (Have attached my TP Zones -image attached). Similar for$XAGsilver.Bonds, commodities and gold today are starting to signal risk off conditions. I've written in mynewslettera read regarding the next possible heavy volatility day on October 9th, 2024.Why is Oct 9, 2024 important? It's the day the FED releases the minutes from this week's rate cut meeting. (Minutes are released 3 weeks from the meeting).My view seems to be contrarian to what most gurus are saying but doesn't hurt to be cautious here.</content>

      <content>China finally starting a Bull Market?We‚Äôre seeing a big up move today in the HK China Markets during Asian hours; if you recall I did say to hedge the markets and I am still in my China, Long Duration Bonds, Gold & Silver which are still trending upsince I made the call here at the August Lows. Look at how well$MLCO,$NIOperforms today. Unlike other pages, I have been reiterating to buy China at supports these last few months consistently.I am still on the stance that the US rate cuts are bearish for US equities. We are still bullish on momentum for China, Gold, Silver, Bonds - Bitcoin will also follow suit but will have a lag effect and face some headwinds due to more of its global exposure. If you‚Äôre asking what I think moves up next? My best guess would be oil$USOalong with shipping, materials in a few months.Thesis for each:China$HSI: breaking out a multi-year resistance trend line with confluence in fundamental changes by the PBOC (People's Bank of China).Gold$XAU: Japan and China, dumping US treasuries and bonds with the carry trade further unwinding while bolstering increases in gold reserves.Silver$XAG: Cup and Handle convincingly broke out and Gold to Silver Ratio still shows that its yet to make its big move.Long Duration US Bonds$TLT: A cut in Interest Rates directly causes bond prices to go up, with long durations more related. As the FEDs tend to do multiple rate cuts and with this larger 50 BPS first cut already unprecedented, it shows some stressors in the US economy.Some other counters to look at:$BABA$YINN$CWEB$NMMSource:China's Major Stimulus; cuts Reserve Requirement Ratios</content>

      <content>Silver$XAGon a rocketship now to 32. I have shifted my TPs for both$XAU$XAGGold and Silver to 2678 and 32.9. I last entered these at 2479 and 26.9 respectively.I think Precious Metals are also signalling a recession. We can see from the Dollar weakness today it's falling even relative to the Yuan$USDCNYdespite the PBoC's Stimulus. It's a race to the bottom as countries outbid to devalue their currency to maintain trade competitiveness, hegemony and foreign trade reserves. Really sad for the less fortunate people who have no assets or aren't financially educated. Inflation is in a nasty course.</content>

      <content>Let‚Äôs talk Inflation: US Dollar on Life SupportWe all know rate cuts imply that the FEDs are printing - why are they doing this? Aside from trade competitiveness, maintaining hegemony and foreign trade reserves. They also need to devalue their ballooning 35 trillion debt; at the point where 30% of all govt revenue goes to paying off the $100 billion per month just in INTEREST payments on the debt. This is why the debt cannot be covered unless forgiven or inflated, less so far as to cut essential social services, etc. Under Biden-Kamala‚Äôs regime, we can see they are simply doing this by devaluing the dollar, and letting assets inflate, hoping the milkshake theory holds, and position into elections (November 5th). Hence equities, commodities, crypto, everything is rallying - essentially back in the roaring 20s just a century later (Off topic: but watch the Great Gatsby, it has a great segment on this üòÄ)We‚Äôre at100.281 on the$DXYtoday. This is reaching a very key point of control and high volume node established in 2015 -2019. I am expect some relief here and a pullback, but the real move like I said should take place around October 9th 2024 for reasons I established earlier in mynewsletter.I am Bipartisan, in that, I don‚Äôt care for any of the policies Democrats or Republicans make, I am not a US Citizen, I only care about the economy. Same goes with China, I am not a fan of communism, but I like the stock prices, if you search$KWEB$BABA$NIOin this chat; I have been screaming to buy at lows at 24, 71, 3.8 respectively - I was even at one point40k down on my 300k exposure to China. Is it too late here? I don‚Äôt think so. I know cheap PE when I see cheap PE. As for Oil$WTI$USO, I think this move comes a few months later. If Trump wins, I am quite bullish on Oil personally due to his deregulation pro-energy policies.</content>

      <content>Refer to my replied message here on update on positions ^^:Still looking at$SPYto 590-605 for the final tap in resistance and$NIOto a double up from my entry at 3.83,$MLCOfrom 5.10, and$KWEBfrom 24-25. All performing extremely well. I have taken profit on my$XAUlongs like I said from 2471 at 2678 fully today.We have Powell speaking 10 minutes before Market open today, along with Yellen and 6 other Fed speakers. Unemployment Claims today shows the Economy is strong, and actually DID NOT necessitate the 50 BPS initial rate cut, which leads me to suspect that this was a desperation move by the FEDs, possibly covering up a recession, along with their approval in extending government funding today.</content>

      <content>I got 5/7 right for these positions^, essentially most of the longs. Been difficult to time the top.I thankfully opted to switch my shorts to calendar spreads so I am close to delta neutral as long as we don't break key regions like 610 on$SPYand 525 on$QQQ. Positional trading so expirations are at least 3 months. Still on the belief rate cuts are bearish andyou should research October 2007 Price Actionafter the September FOMC if you want to know why.</content>

Came into these for a double-up like I said and just about got it.. üêâI rarely give financial opinions here but I am selling calls on these very slightly OTM for split strikes on a 1-3 month expiration, I am happy to be assigned at these prices. ü§ó Worried on headwinds if we get a Middle East War or Ukraine tensions.Like I said, these are speculative bets and NOT YET profitable, so I'll rotate exposure into the more profitable diversified$HSIor$SSI. I took profits on$XAUCFD longs today finally as well. I still see upside but these are my levered positions and I don't want to incur prolonged swap/funding fees.</content>

I will likely be forced to sell my shares at 7.50 like I mentioned in thisscreenshot.My targets for$TLTI bought at 89 is about $120,$KWEBfrom 25 targeting 38-39,$MLCOstill holding. Also bearish neutral on US equities/Crypto since 2 weeks ago during FOMC I updated.My gold$XAUfrom 1800 where I re-longed supports and targeted 2678 is also closed. I am looking at$USO$WTInext.

      <content>US Economy is NOT doing well...Mr Powell I don't feel so good..more rate cuts please ü•∫ The long contraction continues for the Chicago PMI, coming in today at46.6 in Septemberversus 46.1 in August and 45.3 in July. This is its 10th sub-50 reading in a row and the 24th of the last 25 months. It has been stuck in a range of 45.3 to 47.4 for the last four months.The headline PMI is a number from 0 to 100. A PMI above 50 represents an expansion when compared with the previous month.A PMI reading under 50 represents a contractionwhile a reading at 50 indicates no change. ISM last month already showed weakness as I wrote in the last week's newsletter below!Source:Is the booming stock market representative that the economy is doing well?</content>

      <content>Middle East war‚Äî Oil up before GTA6 üß¥Markets are set to close red ü©∏ on October 2nd as tensions escalate in the Middle East. I‚Äôve been steadily building my oil position, believing it‚Äôs been significantly suppressed. Sure, I do occasionally get trades wrong‚Äîoil even went negative in 2020, and I remember Trump boasting about it on TV, justifying bailouts for the oil industry. But my core thesis remains that oil has historically surged during periods of conflict, from the 1973 Embargo to the 1990 Gulf War, and most recently, the 2022 Russia-Ukraine war. üí£Looking ahead, with the Biden/Harris administration nearing its end, let‚Äôs not forget they‚Äôve drained the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to its lowest level in 40 years (attached image). The silver lining is that they plan to, and WILL LIKELY, buy it back at these levels below $70, spurring demand.$WTI$USOüõ¢ Full write-up/video analysis dropping tomorrow!</content>

      <content>What Oil is telling us about the Middle East War1.  Port strikes negatively impact GDP and inflation.2.  Escalation in the Middle East drives oil prices higher, which is detrimental to inflation.3.  We are undergoing one of the largest tightening phases in history, harming GDP.4.  Economic stimulus from China raises commodity prices, with the overcrowded trade short China funds getting margin called.5.  The US face a significant public debt bubble, high valuations, and limited profit growth potential.Biden is depleting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to its lowest levels in decades to artificially lower gas prices. He promised to replenish the SPR when oil hit around $70 per barrel; however, after WTI dropped to $67.70 on September 2, he has not made any purchases.As of October 1, 2024, the US has ONLY JUST started purchasing 6 million barrels for the SPR, with deliveries scheduled through May 2025, according to the Department of Energy. Still, they need to allocate funds from the $110 billion sent to Ukraine.If the Harris Administration hadn‚Äôt relaxed Iranion oil sanctions to obtain oil for the SPR, (they allowed Iran to export their Oil, at the same time funding the Middle East Conflict) they wouldn‚Äôt have been able to engage in this Middle East conflict.Source:Middle East War Breakdown, Oil to Surge</content>

      <content>NFP Non-farm Employment came out actual 254k, over 147k. I closed my shorts of$BTCfrom 64.9k at 60.3k and and$QQQfrom $494 at 479.8 yesterday. Have re-positioned into the open today. I said this on twitter as well; this move will be faded to trap longs. On the longer-term macro, US equities are STILL overbought.I have stood by my China bullish thesis throughout the year and I will stand by my US neutral-bearish positions now. Good jobs data generally implies slower rate cuts, with markets pricing in less 2024 rate cuts! Cheers!ü•Ç</content>

As I mentioned earlier, I‚Äôve closed and hedged all of my Chinese positions at resistance levels, outright selling leveraged positions and placing covered calls on long-term holdings‚Äîtiming it perfectly at the top. Knowing when torealise gainsis equally important!The correction in long bonds (like$TLT, 20Y, and 10Y) is a clear sign that the market doesn‚Äôt believe we‚Äôll see 50 bps rate cuts in the upcoming November/December FOMC meetings. It reflects slowing rate cut expectations despite the FED‚Äôs more aggressive rhetoric, also causing the yield curve to go into negative territory again. I believe this is because they‚Äôre still propping up the stock market ahead of the US elections, which are just about a month away.However, in this latestYouTube video, I explore the possibility of a black swan event, with the middle east conflict still escalating.</content>

      <content>FOMC September Meeting Minutes‚Ä¢  Substantial majority supported a 50 basis point rate cut to 4.75%-5%, aligning policy with inflation and labor market data.  Few participants supported a predictable, slower easing cycle.‚Ä¢  They believed this move would sustain economic and labor market strength while promoting progress on inflation.‚Ä¢  Some participants preferred a 25 basis point cut, citing inflation nearing 2% but acknowledging solid economic growth.‚Ä¢  Several participants favoured a gradual approach with a smaller cut, allowing time to assess policy restrictiveness.‚Ä¢  Participants agreed to continue the path of reducing the Federal Reserve‚Äôs securities holdings, selling bonds.</content>

Unlike Starbucks ‚òïÔ∏è, where sales revenue flows straight to HQ, McDonald‚Äôs franchises 95% of its locations, collecting rent and royalties from franchisees.This model means McDonald‚Äôs profits from real estate, not just food, while ensuring quality control.

      <content>Volatility spikes with Elections & November FOMC 1 week awayüìâ Wall Street slumped Thursday as Microsoft (-5.1%) & Meta (-2.8%) warned of higher AI costs despite strong earnings, cooling tech enthusiasm. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed above 4.3%, adding pressure, while inflation data showed core PCE up 2.7%‚Äîa slight beat, fueling Fed concerns over rate cuts. üìäInvestor focus shifted to AI‚Äôs profitability timeline, with ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù stocks hit hard: Nvidia (-2.8%), Amazon (-1.7%), & Apple (-0.4%). The Dow fell 184 points (-0.44%), the S&P 500 dropped 0.86%, & Nasdaq slipped 1.4%. Meanwhile, energy rose 1% thanks to strong ConocoPhillips results. ‚ö°Ô∏èAs traders await Friday‚Äôs job data & brace for Fed‚Äôs November meeting, the S&P 500 turned negative for October, & the VIX hit a 3-week high, signaling further volatility ahead.I am still holding the belief that US equities will pullback further into and after the elections. With it being a "sell the news" event. I think this will ripple into global markets as well, with China facing regulatory headwinds, and India continuing it's current pullback.

      <content>How to Analyse Financial RatiosüìàEver wondered which stocks are ‚Äúcheap‚Äù or which countries offer value for money? Financial ratios help gauge market valuation, but they don‚Äôt tell the whole story, especially if the Federal Reserve is printing money. It‚Äôs crucial to look deeper into specific sectors.Ranking (Most Expensive to Least Expensive):1. United States (P/E: 26.01)2. India (P/E: 25.75)3. Singapore (P/E: 12.13)4. China (P/E: 9.36)Understanding Basic Financial Ratios:P/E ratio is calculated as Current Market Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS). A high P/E signals growth expectations but may indicate overvaluation.Forward P/E considers projected earnings, providing insights into future growth. Markets with lower P/Es, like China and Singapore, may be undervalued, while the U.S. and India remain at premium levels.

      <content>FED continues Rate Cuts in Nov FOMCFed Chairman Jerome Powell says he won‚Äôt resign even if Donald Trump demands it. Here‚Äôs something many don‚Äôt know: The Fed isn‚Äôt actually part of the government. Unelected officials are controlling your money and fueling inflation.If the Fed were a private company, both it and Chair Powell would have been ousted long ago. Remember, they called inflation ‚Äútransitory‚Äù in late ‚Äô21, only to kick off the steepest rate hike cycle in 40 years in March ‚Äô22.TheU.S. Federal Reserve cut rates yesterday by 0.25%, citing a ‚Äúgenerally eased‚Äù job market and inflation nearing its 2% target. Powell noted that future cuts will depend on economic data, with a goal of maintaining balanced growth. As Trump returns, the Fed‚Äôs policy may face new political pressures with major economic implications.Source:End the FED</content>

      <content>I believe Trump's wins and the continued FED rate cuts will remain to prop the market up, and we remain bullish till the end of year. However, I personally will not heavily invest in the US equities market (especially tech) due to my personal disdain towards their high valuations. I am still in my China positions and only in consumer discretionary (recently into$NKE) again.If you‚Äôre expecting a bigger pullback on the US Market, I think this still comes‚Ä¶ but closer to when we‚Äôre under the neutral Fed Funds rate of 4% (We‚Äôre currently at 4.75% as of yesterday‚Äôs FOMC cut). Generally going under the neutral rate is when the FEDs are panicking over a crisis. Crypto$BTCis very bullish on the monthly now especially withTrump‚Äôs statement on creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (similar to Petroleum)so I won‚Äôt be shorting this.</content>

      <content>Will Oil Continue to Fall?If Trump is elected president, Gold and Bitcoin may rise (as Trump supports Bitcoin), while crude oil could decline due to concerns over his tariff policy and potential trade wars disrupting the global economy. The World Bank projects global commodity prices to reach their lowest levels in five years by 2025 due to an oil surplus.üö® Oil Market Update üö®Oil futures dropped sharply last Monday, marking the largest one-day percentage decline in over two years, as U.S. and global benchmarks fell after Israeli airstrikes on Iran avoided key oil facilities.üìâ Price Moves:‚Ä¢ WTI Crude: Down $4.40 (-6.1%) to $67.38/barrel.‚Ä¢ Brent Crude: Down $4.63 (-6.1%) to $71.42/barrel.‚Ä¢ Gasoline: Down 5.4% to $1.97/gallon.Analysts suggest that easing supply concerns may stabilize oil prices as we enter a weaker demand season.Source:How Trump affects Oil</content>

      <content>The Bond Market is calling the FEDs bluff and suggesting Interest Rates to remain Higher for Longer!The US 10-Year Yield has sharply rebounded from 3.6% in September to 4.5% in November 2024, returning to levels last seen in June. This underscores a tightening cycle, where long-term yields lag, signaling potential cracks in the Fed‚Äôs policy outlook. It also reflects lingering concerns about a second wave of inflation and prolonged higher interest rates.Given this, the December FOMC meeting may result in a pause (at 4.75%) rather than continued easing to neutral rates (FFR 4%). It also suggests the yield curve will remain inverted longer. If the yield curve uninverts and short-term borrowing costs drop, it would signal the Fed‚Äôs intervention to prevent a market crash.TLDR; Heavy cuts could be bearish, hinting that the Fed might know something we don‚Äôt. For now, it seems we‚Äôre pausing and slowing rate cuts, with clear skies ahead.</content>

      <content>G7 Manipulating Canadian Dollar?The Canadian dollar (CAD) has slumped to its lowest levels since April 2020, down 6% this year, driven by a rising unemployment rate (6.8% as of November), weakening economic indicators, and expectations of a 50-basis-point rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC) on December 11.

      <content>What‚Äôs Next for FOMC Rates?With the Federal Reserve‚Äôs meeting minutes set to be released on Wednesday (8/1/2025), the central bank continues to tread carefully as it balances efforts to control inflation with the need to protect the labor market. Inflation remains above the 2% target, while unemployment holds steady at 4.2%.As economic data (jobs/inflation) improve, bond and currency markets suggest rate cuts may slow, with the dollar rallying and risk assets seeing a mild pullback.I anticipate a continuation of 25 BPSin the next meeting as theycut toward neutral FFR, accompanied by hawkish guidance emphasizing that the fight against inflation is far from over.This is reflected in the current bond market,with short-term rates rising while long-term yields fall, signaling near-term hawkishness and caution about future growth.Source:What's next for rates?</content>

High debt levels standing at 36 trillion, rising polarization, rising wealth inequality, declining productivity growth (look at real numbers instead of nominal) and diversification away from the Dollar; all of which are Ray Dalio's key indicators that a nation that is collapsing soon.

      <content>Stagflation Concerns?As I highlighted before, there is a growing possibility of stagflation in 2025, and recent economic data is reinforcing these concerns. Stagflation, a scenario where the economy experiences slow growth alongside persistent inflation, could very well become a reality, as seen in the latest trends and market reactions. Quite interesting to see an uptick in demand because it was driven by tariff concerns and not strong economic fundamentals. Takes a keen eye to notice it in the ISM reports!Source:US Economic Data Sparks Market Volatility</content>

      <content>China China ChinaWhile UST yields are soaring, China treasury yields are dipping to rock bottom. Investors are afraid of a deflationary spiral and are piling into bonds to capitalise on whatever yields are left. China's government will need to navigate a challenging environment to balance growth and inflation while leveraging fiscal policy and bond yields to stabilize the economy. I believe that while history doesn't repeat itself, and often rhymes, China isn't stupid enough to let itself run into a lost decade just like Japan, especially if its competing for superpower status.Source:China's Inflation, Bond Yields, Financial Markets, and Commodities</content>

      <content>2025 Outlook on AsiaQuite a loaded article on a few Asian markets. Geopolitical risks, global supply chain disruptions, and potential tightening monetary policies from major central banks like the US Federal Reserve will likely add pressure on these markets. I believe $NIFTY50,$TAIEXand$SPYare quite frothy especially$SPYwith sitting at around PE of 27. However, the markets could continue its frothy growth for the short term, buoyed by liquidity and continued innovation in sectors like AI, cloud computing, and electric vehicles. Personally, I wouldn't buy in at these levels due to limited upside reward with significant downside risks. To each their own!Source:Asia's Economic Outlook 2025: Stocks & Sectors</content>

      <content>Distinct Head and Shoulders pattern, which is a bearish pattern formed at the top of a market rally or local high. All those who kept yapping about Winter Rally are now silent. The move up during end December did not make another all time high and MACD indicates bearish signal of loss of momentum. On the weekly, MACD line has crossed below the MACD signal line, indicating medium term bearishness.

      <content>What Happened on Inauguration |$TRUMPand$MELANIATokensThe$TRUMPmeme token launched just two days before the inauguration, sparking debates about its timing. üá∫üá∏It briefly flipped Layer 1$SUI, hitting $15 billion market cap within 48 hours!Meanwhile,$MELANIA(his wife) is down 70% from its peak in just 2 days.Why Meme Coins Are Risky:‚ö†Ô∏è Fake Volume: Market makers & wash trading can create false demand on CEXes/DEXes.‚ö†Ô∏è Fake Rankings: Paid traffic can boost visibility on screeners.‚ö†Ô∏è Manipulation: Large holders pump prices by delaying sales.Even when it seems like token ownership is ‚Äúdiversified,‚Äù multiple wallets can still belong to a single entity. Some hide this well; others, not so much. For example, the recent Hawk Tuah Girl Token shows concentrated supply among a few wallets. Even if they split tokens across multiple accounts, they could still retain control.You can see insane gains like 1,000%, but those profits are also not guaranteed to be liquid. Just throwing caution to the wind!</content>

      <content>Trump Ignores ChinaWe didn't see anything mentioned about China since Trump entered office, which provided a relief rally across Asian markets. I still believe tariffs are coming underway but not as feared as investors think. Also I believe China's push to expand imports is a smart move to balance its trade and boost its domestic economy. While tariffs might create short-term instability, they could drive China to deepen economic reforms, benefiting long-term global stability. China needs to fix its domestic issues though like property sector and domestic demand.Source:China's Trade Strategy and U.S. Tariff Talks</content>

      <content>Silver a Buy?The current gold-silver ratio sits at around 89, which usually indicates that we should switch away from gold and buy silver. Silver also faces supply side issues, where silver mines face their own challenges of declining ore grades and rapidly rising mining costs.

      <content>Singapore Reduces the S$NEER SlopeIn a rare policy shift, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has decided to ease its monetary policy, marking the first adjustment since March 2020, when the global pandemic prompted a broad response from central banks. The move comes as Singapore's economy faces weaker-than-expected growth, compounded by global economic challenges. The MAS plans to lower the nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, reducing the pace at which the Singapore dollar appreciates against a basket of its major trading partners' currencies.Source:Singapore Eases Monetary Policy Amid Economic Slowdown</content>

      <content>Why the US Debt could cause a Recessionüö® The US hit its $36.2T debt ceiling, forcing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to take ‚Äúextraordinary measures‚Äù to avoid a meltdown.With a debt-to-GDP ratio worse than any 1st-world country, including Canada, the US faces bankruptcy risks if the ceiling isn‚Äôt raised - so they will simply kick the can further down the road AGAIN üóëÔ∏èüí∏ Interest payments alone now exceed $1T annually, fueling fears of defaults and inflation. Imo, a second inflation spike and a return to rate hikes seem likely.

      <content>PBOC's Reverse RepoThe People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC) just made a major move, injecting a record $234 billion into the financial system through reverse repos.

      <content>January FOMC Decision Market Analysis/UpdateI still see the top-side target for BTC around $110K‚Äì$120K as previously mentioned. These are not levels to be buying at. While it may sound outlandish, I believe we‚Äôre in for a second inflation spike later this year, forcing the Fed to hike rates again, especially if pressured to match the BoJ‚Äôs tightening stance. Crypto seems to be very tied to M2 Money Supply now.Right now, bond and options markets are only pricing in a 25% chance of this 'rate hike' scenario. Barclays analysts still expect slightly lower rates in 2025 but aren‚Äôt ruling out hikes.The FOMC decision yesterday was already priced in, and we did see a rally, but taking profits/cash is a good option for now. I expect a small pullback by mid-February before the rally resumes, with a larger correction in Q3/Q4 when rate hikes return.</content>

      <content>U.S. Trade War BeginsWhile the administration asserts that tariffs will not lead to inflation, economists warn of potential economic disruptions, including increased production costs and retaliatory actions from trading partners. Removing tariffs could be politically unpopular for both sides involved, particularly given the current political climate. For the U.S., lifting tariffs could be seen as a sign of weakness or a retreat from a strong stance on protecting domestic industries and jobs, which is a key part of President Trump's policy platform. Implications on different financial assets are mentioned in the article!Updates:U.S. Economy: Tariffs may reduce U.S. economic output by 0.4% over the next decade, leading to inflation and higher consumer prices.Canada & Mexico: Both countries are retaliating with their own tariffs, targeting key sectors like agriculture, energy, and automotive, disrupting vital North American trade.China: While initially focusing on legal action through the WTO, China faces tariff-induced cost increases in tech, electronics, and textiles.Source:U.S. Tariffs on Canada, Mexico, & China: Economic Impact</content>

      <content>U.S. Market & Trade War UpdateI still believe the U.S. market is overvalued. Trump has followed through on a lot of his plans‚Äîhe‚Äôs already signed away many of Biden‚Äôs deals and imposed tariffs, albeit mostly as threats. I think his austerity measures will eventually pull down the markets, and by Q3-Q4, we‚Äôll likely see him offset fiscal tightening with monetary easing, something he's already pushing for. This move could push markets back up in the short term, but I expect the overall impact to be negative.Tariffs on Mexico PausedU.S. tariffs on Mexico are NOW paused for a month. In exchange, Mexico will deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to the border to curb illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking. Trump confirmed the deal but did not mention efforts to stop weapons trafficking.</content>

They offer no intrinsic value and only transfer wealth from late investors to early ones, much like a game of musical chairs where only a few are left standing when the music stops.

      <content>2025 Market UpdateSame charts as last year (reference above), I think we top around 140-170k this cycle for$BTCand this happens around June-August. There is still upside but I don't feel the same for Alts; this cycle Bitcoin will show the rest of Crypto who is boss. Not touching US tech stocks with a stick still. Only in$LMTcause I like my defence stocks.Gold$XAUlike I mentioned for the past year will get to the big psychological 3000 number, with Silver$XAGstarting to wake up, i still expect 50-60 on this.China has fully bottomed and I believe the AI$BABAtrain has begun, but will still feel pullbacks if global trade supply chains are dampened by US trade policies. I think long-dated bonds$TLTare bottoming out now.All subject to change if market winds shift. My 2 cents. GLHF ü´µüèº</content>

      <content>China's Response to TrumpChina has retaliated against Trump's recent tariffs with targeted measures including new tariffs on U.S. imports (coal, LNG, crude oil) and export controls on critical minerals like tungsten. China‚Äôs strategy seems more calculated to cause pain for U.S. industries while limiting harm to its own economy. Additionally, China‚Äôs significant influence over global supply chains gives it leverage, especially in sectors like technology and defense. I still see it as a lose lose situation!Source:China's Strategic Retaliation to Trump's Tariffs</content>

      <content>Trump's Favourite Word: TariffsTrump's just dropped a bombshell with a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports. It's like he's playing a risky game of economic chess, aiming to protect U.S. industries but risking a global trade war. I believe there will be short-term gains for domestic steel companies, but long-term, it's going to be rising consumer prices and potential job losses in industries that rely on these materials!Source:Trump's Tariff Plan: Economic Strategy or Sabotage?</content>

      <content>$NIOPredictionEarnings date: 03/05/2025Bull Case (Leaning towards this):Given deliveries (known at 72,689) and stimulus tailwinds, NIO likely beats revenue at $2.9-$3 billion. Margins improve to 11%-12% due to alloy savings, yielding -$0.30 EPS. The stock‚Äôs lack of pre-earnings run-up suggests a 20%-30% pop to $5.10-$5.50 if guidance excites (e.g., 440,000 units for 2025, Firefly/ET9 traction). Post-earnings, $5.50-$6 by April 2025 is feasible if macro holds.Bear Case:If price wars hit harder than expected, Q4 revenue undershoots at $2.7 billion (below $2.8B consensus), with margins slipping to 9% due to ONVO‚Äôs low ASPs and discounting, resulting in -$0.45 EPS. Guidance disappoints at 380,000 units for 2025 with profitability pushed beyond Q4 2025. The stock drops 10%-15% to $3.80-$3.60, with tariff fears and a Hang Seng pullback capping recovery; a slide to $3 or below is possible by April 2025 if sentiment sours further.</content>

      <content>Where I see markets headed:Dollar Devaluation:I expect the dollar to weaken without Fed rate hikes or cuts, preserving the current 4.25-4.5% range. This stasis aids devaluing the $36T debt, reducing its real burden.Musk & DOGE:Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE will likely enforce austerity, slashing $2T from spending. This curbs deficits, creating space for future rate cuts if needed.Monetary Policy:I foresee a continued pause on rate cuts in 2025, but backdoor QE will emerge‚Äîdraining the Reverse Repo ($350B) and Treasury General Account ($700B). These moves inject liquidity, support markets, and subtly weaken the dollar.Market Outlook:I think Bonds have bottomed, unless Japan and China continues to unwind positions to bolster purchasing of gold. Silver will start creeping up, running up on the lag on gold as well. Crypto still has another leg up. US Equities as well but not before a pullback. However, imo 2nd half of the year feels dicey, primed for a larger correction.Source:Talking Gold & Precious Metals</content>

      <content>ByBit just hacked for potentially 1.3 Billion in EthereumBybit confirmed a sophisticated attack on Feb 21, 2025, targeting an ETH multisig cold wallet during a transfer to a warm wallet. The signing interface was spoofed, hiding altered smart contract logic that redirected funds to an unknown address.A digital asset security platform might have prevented this. Solutions like Fireblocks use Multi-Party Computation (MPC), replacing multisig‚Äôs on-chain vulnerabilities with off-chain signing and air-gapped cold storage, BitGo‚Äôs multisig with cold storage, Anchorage‚Äôs HSM-backed custody, and Copper‚Äôs MPC-hybrid also bolster security could have fixed this.Just some shoddy security overall‚Ä¶ Bybit‚Äôs setup likely lacked these, exposing a single point of failure.Exact losses (rumoured $1.4B)are unclear, but the breach underscores a need for layered defenses beyond basic multisig.This is looking bearish on Crypto, given the falling US equities and Bond Markets pricing in some end February weakness on risk assets as well.Source:ByBit confirms Eth Hack</content>

      <content>Trump's Additional TariffsTrump‚Äôs latest 10% tariff on China, effective March 4, escalates the trade war, risking global economic fallout. I believe Trump is using this as a negotiation tactic rather than starting an economic war because it's a lose lose for all. China's diversification of its exports and massive trade surplus may lessen the bite of tariffs on its economy.Remember that Trump's policies bring short-term pain to the economy and financial markets but are generally healthier long-term! His administration has shown sensitivity to stock market performance, with Trump often touting market gains as a metric of success. Look at how he had to delay the tariffs because markets were initially tanking upon tariff announcements!Source:Trump‚Äôs Tariff Hike: China Trade War Risks and Gains</content>

      <content>Trump's Crypto Strategic ReserveTrump announced that he is working on the Crypto Strategic Reserve which will adopt these cryptocurrencies‚ÄîBitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano‚Äîinto its framework. Quite coincidental that there was a selloff along with equities because of tariff fears just to announce it after and pump crypto up again!This can go both ways to be honest. Government endorsement could attract more institutional investors to adopt crypto as a form of investment. If the government decides to sell its holdings in the future, it could flood the market, causing price drops. The reserve could distort market dynamics, creating a moral hazard where investors rely on government intervention (lender of last resort).If equities continue to bleed when market opens then we could see a crypto selloff!

      <content>Gonna punt a tiny$BTCshort soon. Very tiny short ladders at the 2 red regions with 86-87k (30%) and 91.6-92.6k (70%). I am not as confident of this short because while it is low volume, we've seen this market rally off low volume and manipulation before.However, I believe the trend is down till at least 72k to potentially 68k where we fully bottom. However, if we do that, it means that that would be the impulse Elliot Wave C and it would mark the end of the cyclical bull market. Not ruling it out.</content>

      <content>$BTCto $70k? Crypto Reserve Faces ObstaclesI think Trump‚Äôs Crypto Reserve is a bold but reckless idea and a flashy political move that ignores the messy reality of getting anything done in a divided government. During his run for presidency, he flipped to support crypto‚Äîdespite being anti-crypto in his first term‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs a rare issue with no divided masses or opposition pressure, unlike rallying a specific group that always sparks pushback.Crypto is wildly volatile which can swing double digits in a day. This makes it a nightmare for stable, long-term planning, unlike traditional reserves like oil or gold.$BTChas bled most of its gains after his announcement of the Crypto Reserve. If this optimism continues to die down we could see it fall further to $70k!Source:Trump‚Äôs Crypto Reserve Faces Red State & Congress Hurdles</content>

      <content>Positions Update:We have convincingly broken down below the 200MA across$BTC$QQQ$SPY. If you were on my livestream or joined from there yesterday, I did say I am still in my$BTCshorts from 94k targeting 72k, possibly even extending to 68k - That should align with my$QQQtarget of 445-435.If you scroll above you would see that I publicly gave the short from 98k$BTCafter the ByBit hack into flipping long at 78k and targeting 94k (sounds ridiculous but I actually prepared for that). Now I am saying prepare for sub 70k, but DO NOT short below 75k.(98k $BTC short targeting 80k close)(80k $BTC long targeting 86k close)(92k $BTC short targeting 72k close)- I gave all the entry and exits way in advance.We are here now. Once again, just my 2 cents - Trying to interpret the market for y'alls ü§ôüèª Don't claim to be the best, but if you've been here long enough you'd have seen me do this before.</content>

      <content>Actually still the same chart for$BTC^ (refer to above)targeting 72-74k for closing shorts and a possible wick under 70k (i‚Äôll rely a lot on price action and liquidation data on that day). Same reason why I chose to long at 80k before the 94k the previous time (too many late shorts allowing for a squeeze up).Right now,in my core portfolio, I am still long Bonds and China.Still in my$TLTpositions from $87 targeting $110; (doing the Wheels Strategy here)& still in$BABAfrom $73 - I targeted $145-155 anticipating significant resistance here so I am still selling calls & am close to collecting $12 in premiums which is going to make my average buys for$BABA$61 üòÇ (goal is to make this position $0 cost).I have shared this before as well months back (scroll up).I believe this US equities pullback and Trump's Tariffs will present very short-term headwinds for China, but I don't believe we're pulling back much. Will go on livestream again in a bit.</content>

      <content>How China will compete with Trump's Tariffs? ü´°üêâHow? By devaluing the Yuan to counter Trump‚Äôs tariffs and keep exports cheap!Trump‚Äôs plan: 10% tariffs on Chinese goods, 25% on Mexico & Canada to block China‚Äôs backdoors.China‚Äôs move to devalue the Yuan softens the tariffs‚Äô impact, but Trump is betting big that taxes on Chinese Goods will force change.I believe the Trade War will develop into a Currency war with Mexico and Canada following suit to devalue against the dollar.What does this mean?

      <content>FOMC Decision: 50 BPS Rate Cuts Projected for 2025!FOMC‚Äôs March 19, 2025 decision kept rates at 4.25%-4.5%, reflecting caution as inflation stays above 2%. Powell pointed to Trump‚Äôs tariffs as a factor in rising üî• inflation expectations, suggesting rate cuts might pause if costs rise. Yet despite this, The Fed still sees 50 bps of cuts in 2025, aiming for 3.9%. As I said previously above^.The Fed will slow Treasury redemptions to $5B from April, hinting at QE-like moves. Risk assets are already reflecting this shift,$BTC$NQ$EQ$TLTmoving upwards üìàI actually think Powell dislikes Trump??

      <content>Are Bonds telling us we are entering a Recession?Is$TLTbeing stuck at the $80-90 telling us something? üé£In my opinion, current economic data hints at a recession‚Äî with consumer confidence at 98.3, jobless claims at 242K, GDP at 2.3%.Earlier last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott¬†Bessent's¬†pledge to contain yields on 10-year Treasury notes - getting the long and more sensitive end of the curve lower.These statements caused Yields to fall‚Äî10Y at 4.308% (19/3/2025), down from 4.51% last month‚Äîpushed by recession fears and easing term premia (-4.9bp). Yet Inflation remains low & steady at 2.6%, presenting a bullish case for$TLTto rise. üî•As you guys know, I‚Äôm Bullish Bonds; With the trade war, slowing inflation and Bessent bent on  I see more short-term currency devaluations > Lower Yields > Higher Bond Prices.However, in the article below, i‚Äôll present some bear cases for bonds just for consideration.Source:Does the Bressert Cycle Analysis explain why Bonds are still not a buy?</content>
